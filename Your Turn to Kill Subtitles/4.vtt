00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.820
A casual conversation</i>

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.700
led to a nasty game of writing
the names of people we want to kill</i>

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.740
and telling each other...</i>

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.580
The name l wrote
was Yutaro Yamagiwa!</i>

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.980
Two people could have been killed.</i>

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.780
You said the rule is to kill someone
if a person killed for you.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.180
There is no such rule.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.140
Mr Fujii has been receiving
threatening notes.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.820
Hello, Mr Atsushi Fujii.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.220
It is your turn to kill!

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.020
Then, there is one more.</i>

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.620
Who is this?

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.380
Number 214, Mr Tanaka.
Mr Masao Tanaka.</i>

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.100
The Bhutanese diner's owner?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
You are Mr Masao Tanaka?</i>

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.180
Is this over now?
Or will more people die?</i>

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.610
It was beyond my imagination.</i>

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.380
Explosion in Bhutanese Diner.
One Dead Body Found.</i>

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.900
Owner, Masao Tanaka</i>

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.940
Did gas leak cause the explosion?</i>

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.580
ls this Masao Tanaka
the patient from the other day?

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.940
Gosh! Will you not peek?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.140
I was just checking whether you were
watching porn again or not.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.860
It was infected with a virus
and you got into trouble.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.230
Really?

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.790
Yes.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.290
The diner's owner was a Japanese man
named Masao Tanaka.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.650
That means...

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.290
You're not thinking that
it is your turn to kill, right?

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.550
Is it possible that
Mr Fujii killed him?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.790
There indeed was a gas leak,
and it caused the explosion.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.660
Thank goodness...

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.550
l don't know if l should say that,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.580
but that means
it wasn't the game, right?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
But the property manager,
Dr Yamagiwa and the diner owner

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.820
all had their names written
in the game.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.500
Isn't it too unnatural?

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.500
I agree with him.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.830
So l drew this.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.480
Let's say, if the property manager
didn't kill himself

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.360
but was killed by
one of the residents,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.840
it was the turn of the person who
wanted to kill him to go to kill.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.440
Murderer B killed the property
manager and threatened Mr Fujii</i>

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.560
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.760
What do you mean?

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.470
Didn't Mr Fujii say the other day...

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.090
Someone killed the person
whom you want dead,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.330
so you have to kill the person
on the ballot paper you drew,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.450
or you will violate the rule.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.410
But he was joking, right?

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.810
But in fact,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.120
Mr Fujii wrote "Dr Yamagiwa"
and after Yamagiwa was killed,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.840
someone threatened Mr Fujii and said
it was his turn to kill, right?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.840
If that's the case,
the person who is Murderer B

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.120
could have been threatened
by Murderer A too.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.920
Now it has really become
a murder-swap.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.040
It is unbelievable,
but there are too many coincidences.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.480
So, there were 13 people
at that time,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.520
and we exchanged ballot paper.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.480
If Mrs Tezuka is right,
that means 10 more people...

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.200
will possibly die?

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.810
It is your turn to kill</i>

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.530
And you wrote the owner's name?

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.370
It didn't occur to me
that he'd really be killed.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.640
And the person who killed someone

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.290
would send scary notes that say,
"lt is your turn to kill."

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.210
And it's this one?

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.610
- Let's call the police.
- l can't. l won't!

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.170
We can't tell the police!

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.650
Because l overstayed my visa?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.730
It's not just you, Cuong.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.490
For everyone's sake,
we can't let the police come near.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.130
Wait a minute.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.610
I get it that you wrote
the owner's name.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.570
You drew a piece of paper too,
what was written on it?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.930
Oh, it's that person?

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.810
- You know them?
- You see, a while ago...

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.490
Please do one last thing for me.</i>

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.280
Just one step, please give me
the final support...</i>

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.320
Actually...

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.090
Yes?

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.330
Sorry, something frightening
just occurred to me again.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.610
What is it?

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.930
The person written on the paper
might not be someone close to us.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.490
Indeed.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.530
Someone would've been killed
somewhere a long time ago.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.770
It'll never end if we think
in a negative way, so let's stop it.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.080
Your Turn to Kill</i>

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.230
Episode 4</i>

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.790
Turn your socks inside-out
before putting them in the basket.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.310
Are you listening?

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.080
Yes, great detective.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.870
Stop calling me that.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.830
About the explosion
at the Bhutanese diner...

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.960
Was it really an accident?

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.080
It was a gas explosion.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.280
Then, did you notice
that people around us...

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.900
have been dying one after next?

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.360
All right,
what does this fact tell us?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.180
Okay, it's Orangutan Time.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.380
I have no idea.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.480
I'll answer it!

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.400
It means that we have reached
the level of great detectives!

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.040
You see, murders happen
wherever a great detective goes,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.120
so doesn't it make you feel
that we've become great detectives?

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.480
Are you having fun?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.560
Does people close to you
dying one after next amuse you?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.440
You've been feeling down,

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.200
so l thought maybe you would
relax a bit if l said that.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.310
I shouldn't have cheered you up
like that.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.270
Sorry.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.070
It's okay. Thank you.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.440
But you can cheer me up more by
turning your socks inside-out first.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.280
I'll do it properly.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.410
You said that the other day too.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.120
This time l really will.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.320
Don't your socks turn inside-out
naturally when you take them off?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.040
Fine, l'll do it! You're annoying.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.840
I say this because you didn't do it.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.610
- The cat at the carpark...
- Don't sing Natsuiro...

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.320
when you're in the wrong.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.080
Sorry.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.650
Nine, and just one more.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.040
Ten.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.880
Okay, well done.
You can let go of it now.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.400
Okay.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.000
What's wrong?

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.000
I am feeling down.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.320
Obviously.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:09.010
My wife hasn't been herself lately,
like she is distant.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.590
Even so, you shouldn't show it
when you're working.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.990
But l could instruct
the last member cheerfully.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.670
Well, it's okay to
show your weakness in front of me.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.030
I am sorry.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.160
So, how has your wife been acting?
Tell me.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.230
You'll be surprised when l tell you.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.150
Okay.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.550
First, something shocking

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.110
has been happening around
our residential tower.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
I'm sorry.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.770
It's okay. We're even now.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.050
It is 1:10 pm now,

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.250
you're listening to Fan Fan J-Pop,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.730
an old J-Pop song programme.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.610
I am your host, Sumika Kitagawa.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.830
You are really close.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.600
Hello.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.480
Misato.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.440
Yes?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.440
It's a good thing for you.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.040
Yes?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.480
That you can take care of me.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.080
It makes you look like a good wife
to other people.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.320
You're worth nothing if you
don't have to take care of me.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.920
You're just a big woman.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.280
Thank you.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.780
Your habit from working as a barmaid
shows when you thank me.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.060
Thank you!

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.980
If you don't use your head,
the nutrients go to your body.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.960
Sora.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800
Where is your mum?

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.600
She isn't home yet?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.680
Have you had supper?
Do you want to have it with me?

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.080
No, thank you.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.400
Let's have supper.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.360
lt's here.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.090
Isn't this where the
property manager jumped?

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.830
- It is.
- l'll get some salt!

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.400
We don't have enough time.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.600
We do!

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.640
Yes, l went to the diner
regularly, but...

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.240
Has anything strange
happened lately?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.040
We asked the waitress,
but she said she didn't remember.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.320
Oh.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.480
The girl can't speak Japanese
at all, so it was difficult.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.800
"At all," you said?

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.160
Why?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.840
That reminds me, when he came to
our hospital the other day,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.840
he said the diner's stove was broken
and he was at a loss what to do.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.640
When l went there after that,
l did smell gas.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.800
I see.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.440
By the way,
do you live here alone?

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.720
Yes, l am single.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.120
Thank you. Let's go.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.640
Sorry to bother you on your day off.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.200
What are you doing? Let's go!

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.000
It's the office used by
the caretaker who jumped off here.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.520
I know! Heaven will punish you!

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.720
The waitress who worked at
the exploded diner lives here too.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.480
The regular customer just now
lives here too.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.040
It's totally cursed here.
Let's run away now.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.200
The flat just now was creepy too.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.600
Come on.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.600
- I forgot one person.
- What?

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.560
He lives here too.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.240
Enomoto?

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.920
He's the head of
Community Safety Division, right?

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.960
Let's leave through the front.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.120
I don't want to be involved
in their trouble.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.200
Don't just say yes, seriously.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320
Detectives?

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.600
My husband pretended
he didn't realise they were here,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.280
but they stood in front of
the manager's office.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.960
That means he really
didn't commit suicide?

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.440
I don't know.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.170
What do you think?

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.690
The police might as well
just solve the case.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.400
Why did your husband
pretend he didn't see them?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.320
The police officers are sticklers
when it comes to jurisdiction.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.520
Oh? There are only a few of us?

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.520
- You're right where we want you.
- Why?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.080
Were you involved in the explosion
the other day in any way?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.600
Wait...

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.830
I'm not Mr Tamiya, but the fear and
suspicion is trying.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
- Let's ask him openly.
- But...

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.740
You blamed me when
the property manager died too.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.880
That was what l thought too.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.000
How nasty of you.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.120
So, were you?

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.320
Well...

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.280
as the diner's regular customer,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.360
l only provided information
to the police,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.640
and I'm innocent.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.480
I see.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.040
I am sorry.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.600
I have no motive to kill
the diner owner to begin with.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:17.320
If l have no motive, nobody will
even suspect me. Am l right?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.080
Motive...

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.600
That's right.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.680
You have no motive.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.440
Exactly. None at all.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.760
Okay, l won't ask anymore.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.920
Please don't mention it
to me either.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.240
Hello.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.760
Sorry, we're late.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.360
Let's have a seat.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.800
All right, let's start our meeting.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.520
Haven't we had a residents' meeting
the other day?

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.360
We've been having urgent ones,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.410
but this is our regular meeting.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.010
It's unusual that
Mr Tamiya isn't present.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.010
He set up security cameras himself,
is that all right?

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.050
What?

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.770
It's still fine if there had been
incidents like burglaries...

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.750
He said he wanted to
make this a better place.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.450
I asked him what he was doing.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.570
He said he wanted to
make this place better.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.570
He said he has aged

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.800
and wanted to make the world better
for the young people,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.720
and it was a part of
the activities for that.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.050
This is great.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.240
Could Mr Tamiya have killed him?

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.360
Why?

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.800
Who did he kill?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.760
Oh, l don't know who,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.530
but maybe he used the cameras to
keep an eye out for the police.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.670
Saying that he killed someone
just because he put cameras there

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.570
is jumping to a conclusion.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.690
Yeah...

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.970
lf Mr Tamiya had killed someone,

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.050
we'll all be arrested for
committing that crime.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.450
Inducement of murder.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.690
Yes, that.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:09.810
What are you talking about?

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.770
It seems that
if someone dies in the game,

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.290
it's possible that everyone involved
will be just as guilty.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.170
This is unreasonable!

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.130
I have no such intention at all!

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.210
Indeed.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:24.730
We all think it's unreasonable.
Will we drop this topic?

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.610
Can we just pretend that we didn't
play the game in the first place?

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.610
New facts have been found.</i>

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.100
Doctor Yutaro Yamagiwa,
whose body was found last month,</i>

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.540
was a graduate of Touo University's
medical department,</i>

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.020
and worked as a GP.</i>

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:45.960
Touo University Hospital</i>

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.500
He had been appearing in
breakfast shows and variety shows,</i>

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.820
and expanded his field of work.</i>

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.160
Actually...

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.620
l want to say something
regarding the game.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.820
I just said we should
drop the topic.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.700
Actually, at that time,

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.300
l wrote my own name.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.220
Yoko lshizaki</i>

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.180
What?

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.860
Why did you do that?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.540
Because there was no one
l want to kill or want dead.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.060
What's wrong with you all, to have
written names so casually!

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.500
I didn't write it casually!

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.500
It was just the atmosphere
at that time...

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.860
You can kill someone
just because of that?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.540
We didn't go that far.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:29.940
Anyway,

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.940
someone drew the piece of paper
with my name on it, right?

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.700
Who is it?

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.620
I wrote it!

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.540
Don't try to kill me
even by mistake.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.390
Why don't you say anything?

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.150
Wait, you are scaring me.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.260
Please don't kill me!

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.420
Maybe it was someone
who is absent today.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.700
When did we decide

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.260
that we have to kill the person on
the piece of paper?

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.100
This is ridiculous!

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.740
If we instigate anxiety here, it'll
influence children in a bad way.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.500
Who'd have thought that you would
mention influence on children?

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.940
What do you mean?

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.540
Fine.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.940
Let's tell each other clearly
what name we wrote,

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.740
then we'll all feel relieved.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.100
- Mrs Tezuka, we'll start from you.
- What?

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.540
Say it. Who do you want dead?

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.750
Sorry, l am late.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.870
Please continue.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.070
Miss Kinoshita,
our meeting just finished.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.550
But l heard someone shouting
from outside.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.830
Our conclusion is we have nothing to
talk about this month.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:04.790
But you just...

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.230
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.070
- Thank you...
- Wait, what's going on?

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.470
Wait.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.030
Miss Kinoshita, don't use force.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.300
It hurts! Wait!

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.340
Your hands are wet!

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.300
The good season has come.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.380
Let's end the meeting for real.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.860
Thank you, everyone...

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.900
- Mrs Tezuka.
- Yes?

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.300
I am not convinced.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.780
Why?

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.540
What name did you write?

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.900
You started the game,
so you should tell me first.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.390
No, l didn't start the game.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.470
Come on.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.510
How can we say what name we wrote
in front of everyone?

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.790
But if you could be killed,
you would also...

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.470
Sachiko Akaike.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.620
It isn't the name l wrote.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.100
It's the name on
the ballot paper l got.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.700
So at least,
I'm not going to kill you.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.060
Are you happy now?

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.500
I cannot be.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.900
What the heck?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.420
There are other people...

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.420
Sachiko Akaike?

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.740
She is Room 502's old lady.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.300
Yes.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.790
So the one who wrote it
must have been Mrs Akaike.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:25.950
What you were trying to do just now

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.750
was to get Mrs Akaike to
tell everyone that

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.750
she wanted to kill
her mother-in-law.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:32.550
Well...

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.830
l can understand
why she wanted to write the name.

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.790
I thought the two of them
were very close.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.630
No, they had a fight the other day.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.510
She kept chanting,
"Fried meat cake..."

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.310
She kept shouting "fried meat cake."

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.030
You talk a lot today.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.670
Speaking of that, there's something
wrong with Mrs Akaike too.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.750
Misato is very nice!

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.430
You didn't realise?

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.110
She'd never say anything back
when l talk to her.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.990
The wind chime is so noisy.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.980
Right?

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.980
He's the doctor who goes on
tabloid shows as a pundit.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.380
Mr Fujii is the person involved,
but he's absent.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.700
You're imagining things.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.260
No, l am sure.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.780
I talked to her on purpose
to confirm this.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.940
Do you have any clue why?

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.980
No idea.

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.380
Well, I'm used to people hating me
because of my job.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.940
Anyway, l talked about the paper
in the flow of our conversation.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.540
What about you guys?

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.620
It's okay to say
the name someone else wrote!

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.830
Tell me what's on
your pieces of paper.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.990
Do sit down.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.030
Come on!

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.420
The name on my piece of paper
was Oda Nobunaga.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.660
Oda Nobunaga</i>

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.660
What?

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.340
The person probably had nobody
they want dead,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.660
and just wrote a random name.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.240
That's clever!
l should've wrote that.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.320
The name on my piece of paper
is Yoshimura.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.090
But l don't know who it is.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.730
None of the residents here
is called Yoshimura.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.470
The name on my piece of paper
was Takafumi Kono.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.630
In Hiragana.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.670
No one is called Kono either.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.330
Old Mrs Akaike is the only one
we know for sure.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.270
I hope she won't be killed.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.310
But Mr Ukita, you're the one
who has the piece of paper.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.910
She won't be killed
if you don't do anything.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:35.430
No, I'm saying,

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:40.030
Mrs Akaike could take advantage of
the game and kill the old lady.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:45.150
If l have no motive, l won't even
be suspected. Am l right?

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.420
That's right.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.540
You have no motive.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.860
Exactly. None at all.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.900
No way.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.340
Most mothers-in-law and wives
want to kill each other.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.940
If they seem to get along,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.940
it's because one of them
is insensitive.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.070
I think it will be okay.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.780
You never know.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.870
Lately, everyone looks like
a murderer to me.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.080
What's the matter?

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.640
Nothing. lt's nothing.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.520
I'll make supper now.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.960
Okay.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.360
Who'd have thought that you would
mention influence on children?

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.360
- Gosh, Nana!
- Yes?

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.360
You're gloomy every time
after the residents' meeting!

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.600
Am l?

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.920
- Should l go from now on?
- lt's okay.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.530
I'm gloomy because of
something at work.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.120
Work? What happened?

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.760
I don't want to talk about work
in our private time.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.200
But l want to help you, Nana.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.760
I get the energy
to solve the problem alone

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.320
by spending time with you, Shota.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.400
So that's already enough.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.180
I want to solve it with you.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.960
I know how you feel,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.130
but sometimes you solve a problem
better on your own.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:55.090
For example?

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.170
Working out?

00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:01.120
Even if l do something next to you,
it won't help you build muscles.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.040
But if you cheer for me,
l can work harder

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.480
and get double the amount of
muscles l can build.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.520
And you can cheer for me just by
staying here by my side.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.560
I'm convinced now.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.600
You don't look convinced.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.560
I'm convinced in my mind,
but my face hasn't caught up.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.530
I'll go to bed. Even my face will be
convinced tomorrow morning.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.370
There's something else.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.650
Please keep it,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.010
and submit it when you want to.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.290
Whenever you submit it,
I'm fine with that.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.290
Okay.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:48.090
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.490
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.940
- Shota.
- Good morning.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:24.280
Aren't you going to be late
for work? Let's hurry.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.200
Ono...

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.130
Oh, that's right! This...

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.050
lt's for you.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.970
Lunchbox? l can't keep taking
things from you...

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.810
Put food inside yourself.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.690
It's just the box?

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.570
The timber was processed
as construction material,

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.970
this was made with the edges that
were going to be thrown away,

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.650
so it is environment-friendly.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.330
Wow, l had no idea.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.770
It was more difficult
than l thought.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.970
Did you make this too?

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:59.410
I am happy that
it makes you so happy.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.570
Well, I'm actually more surprised.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.810
Sorry! l am happy.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.280
You hurt my feelings,
may l change the topic?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.160
Sure, of course...

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.080
ls there anyone you want to kill?

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.760
Why ask it out of the blue?

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.360
It isn't out of the blue.
lt's all we talk about lately.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.320
All of you?

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.700
It's the people who attend
our residents' meeting.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.500
- Why?
- What?

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.760
Your wife didn't tell you?

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.200
It's the game.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.960
It's the Werewolf game, right?

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.720
It isn't Werewolf,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.160
it's the murder-swap game.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.520
Could your wife have been
lying to you?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.370
I wonder why. How strange.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.840
Calm down...

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.040
lt is easy to ask her.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.750
But before that,
l will try to deduce it.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:24.550
Orangutan Time.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.870
Nana said...

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.070
We became friends
after playing Werewolf.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.550
Why did she lie to me?

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.750
And...

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.790
Why did she not tell me
about the murder-swap game?

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.510
Mr Tezuka.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.630
You scare me
when you talk to yourself.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:48.350
Sorry, l can't think
if l don't say it out loud.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.830
Oh...

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:57.150
lf Nana also played the game,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:02.590
that means she wrote the name of
someone she wanted to kill?

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:08.590
But she didn't want to tell me
whose name she wrote,

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.490
so she didn't tell me
about the game.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.710
In that case...

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.640
That means she wrote the name...

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
of someone she doesn't want
to tell me about?

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.530
You look very puzzled.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.180
Mrs Akaike could take advantage of
the game and kill the old lady.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.540
Yes?

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.620
I am Room 302's Tezuka.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:00.980
Please accept it.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.730
Wow... Thank you so much.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.690
That's amazing, Mrs Akaike.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.980
It's got pink, the colour you like.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.370
Sorry,

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.490
l've got nothing to thank you.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.660
It's okay, l thought it wasn't nice
of me to give her a sample,

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.530
but it's easy to move in this,
so l wanted to give it to you.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:22.130
Would it be too flashy?

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.290
No, it will look good on you.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.200
And this is for Misato.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.800
Thank you, l'll give it to her.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.540
You haven't got one for me?

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.010
Oh, l'll bring a men's tracksuit
next time.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.660
Sorry, how assuming l am!

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.010
Mrs Akaike,
why don't you try it now?

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.050
You'll surely look great!

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:47.760
Oh?

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.050
Lately, everyone looks like
a murderer to me.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.760
Okay. This side too.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.170
Is it good?

00:32:57.410 --> 00:32:58.530
Awesome!

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.410
She looks so good!

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.320
You look so good in it!

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.690
- Wow...
- A flashy one like this is great.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.060
Mrs Tezuka.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.530
Thank you.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.220
No need to come and thank me.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.460
Visit us from time to time
if you don't mind.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.140
Sure.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.490
Everyone is gossiping about
the women of our household, right?

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.820
- So they really do?
- No, they don't.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.580
It's a long story,
but it's just natural.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.340
They were raised in different times
and environments,

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.770
it's okay if it was a couple
who love each other,

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.300
but they became family and live
together without knowing each other.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.620
Considering that,
l think they get along.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.020
Yeah, perhaps.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.060
So please don't worry about it,
and visit again.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:56.820
Sure.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.810
Will you at least get out of bed?

00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.250
You're too old to
shut yourself in the room.

00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:15.810
What do you want me to do?

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.540
- Hi ya.
- Hello.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.460
Madam Kinoshita.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.250
Would you read this out for me,
please?

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.820
"My condolences to you."

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.760
"l am the person
introduced just now."

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.000
Totally different.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.080
It is really difficult!

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.590
Will you attend a funeral?

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.090
Yes, the owner of the diner
l worked at.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.010
The one in the fire.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.090
"The destination this time..."

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.290
Japanese people
don't say this clearly.

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:16.450
No?

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.730
It's "... to you."

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.570
Say it like that.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:26.490
Just move your mouth, like you're so
sad that you can't say anything.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:31.370
So just remember "to you"
and you'll be fine.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:32.970
You're helpful.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.410
You aren't as horrible as they say.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.170
See you.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:01.850
For funeral</i>

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.970
lt's the girl just now?

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.970
Coriander crisps</i>

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:24.210
Miss Sawa Kuroshima</i>

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:25.770
l am okay.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.690
Condolence money envelopes</i>

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.680
Hiding something?

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.000
Your wife?

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.320
What do you think?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.360
All married couples
keep a secret or two to themselves.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.800
- But this isn't usual.
- What do you mean?

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120
Well...

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.600
Good evening, Miss Shinohara.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.540
Oh, sorry to call you here suddenly.

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.410
Don't worry about it.
ls it a new product?

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.810
Amazing!
You make things easy for me.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:07.290
The murder-swap game you said
is crazy.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.860
It is, isn't it?

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:13.460
Maybe your wife thinks it's stupid,
so she didn't tell you.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.180
Is that so?

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.580
Well, it's that, or...

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.820
She wrote your name, Sho.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.940
I see!

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.490
She wrote you as the person
she wanted to kill,

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:24.850
so she couldn't tell you.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:31.370
Well, she is cheating on you.
That's for sure.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:38.140
- I didn't tell you, but...
- Yes?

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.300
My wife and l...

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:44.810
love each other to bits!

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.980
So this is totally impossible.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.420
Yeah?

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.200
But if in the unlikely case...

00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:00.140
No, if in the very unlikely case
that Nana wrote my name,

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.740
if this is what Nana wants,
l don't mind dying.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.780
But l'll disguise it as an accident,

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:10.620
so that Nana won't feel guilty.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.470
Oh! You'll help me disguise it as
an accident and push me...

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.390
No!

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.470
Why? Please kill me.

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:19.470
How can you ask such a favour?

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.110
I guess l have to ask her, then.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.950
She worries about it so much
that she couldn't tell you,

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.470
it would be awful of you to ask her
this and that out of curiosity.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.970
I ask because l am worried.
lt's out of kindness.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.410
You can be kind by
letting her worry about it too.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.910
In many cases, letting someone
solve a problem alone

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.190
is for their own sake.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.130
Don't mistake curiosity
for kindness.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:48.770
Okay.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:53.010
I am kind, so l will wait and see
for a bit longer.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.530
Yes.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:05.720
If you'll design it for autumn
and winter, how long do you need?

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:08.390
A week.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:10.030
Thank you!

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:11.230
Don't worry about it.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.070
Thank goodness!

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.910
By the way,
did you move house?

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.510
Oh. Yes, l did.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.630
Could you have bought it?

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.790
Yes, actually.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.630
I'm so jealous! You own a home!

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.110
You say it too loudly!

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:32.150
And your husband is here
at the perfect time.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.090
What?

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:42.130
You are here too?

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.510
Hello.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.970
Oh? Wait...

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.810
Are you having a fight?

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.870
No, we don't mix our job
and our private life.

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.350
Right, Nana?

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:00.990
This is so private.
I'm jealous.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.110
Just joking.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.350
You've helped us so much,
Mr Managing Director.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.830
I'm totally fine with you
getting lovey-dovey.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:07.830
Thank you.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.830
See you later, then.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:11.950
I am counting on you!

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.950
See you.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.350
Oh, that reminds me.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.790
What is this murder-swap game?

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:23.990
Secrets?

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.230
You're so gross.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:27.830
See you.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.270
What is it? Tracksuit?

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.240
Ukita speaking.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.760
About last month's case...

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.480
Got your handkerchief?

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.800
I'm not a kid. l don't need one.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.360
But it might fly everywhere.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.480
Having a handkerchief
won't help, then.

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.990
Sorry, I'm late.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:16.910
It's okay.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.510
I'll cook right now.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.430
- Nana...
- Yes?

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.270
- Look!
- Wow!

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.350
I knew you would be home late,

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.240
so l made supper!

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.920
Thank you!

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.080
Thank you.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.480
They're like outfits for a couple.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.120
Sorry.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.090
What's the matter?

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.550
Dorj's Diner, coupon</i>

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.110
lt is your turn to kill.</i>

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.060
l kind of have an idea
who wrote this.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.320
What will you do?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.160
Happy birthday to you.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.520
Happy birthday to you.

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.640
What? l thought
it was something serious.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.440
Whose birthday is it?

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.520
Happy birthday, dear...

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:34.920
lt's mine!

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.080
- Bon appetit.
- Bon appetit.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.720
So...

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.200
A bit...

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.160
Delicious! I'm so surprised!

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.800
Yes!

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.160
It's Sanae.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.680
Hello?

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.200
Nana? Somehow...

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.040
l heard a noise from above.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.880
I must be imagining things.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.240
Sorry, I'm alone right now,
so I'm worried.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.880
The flat above yours is...

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.520
Room 502...

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.040
the Akaike family.

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:43.710
Let's go.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.520
Mr Fujii?

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.400
Well, l heard a loud voice.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.760
Voice?

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.500
Mr Akaike?

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:30.550
I think they're home.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.670
Excuse me, we're coming in.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:39.750
Excuse--

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:43.130
Hello?

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:50.910
Mrs Akaike!

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.630
I'll call someone here!

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.950
Old Mrs Akaike!

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:07.990
Oh, my Julia!

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.150
Mrs Akaike!

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.830
Mrs Akaike, are you okay?

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:35.070
Mrs Akaike...

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.110
Misato Akaike</i>

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:49.150
Your Turn to Kill

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.830
lf all the residents are suspects,

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:54.270
everyone will say it's
a murderers' condo.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.180
Murderer</i>

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.420
lf you tell me to trust you, l will.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.820
Maybe you'll be killed.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.060
This drama is fictitious</i>
