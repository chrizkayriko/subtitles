00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.850
Is there someone you want to kill?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.250
Everyone has several people
around them

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.890
whom they hate, or want to punch,
or want them to disappear.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.690
Among those people,
there must be at least one

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.210
you would even want dead,
or to kill, if possible.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.730
For example...

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.810
No, it is your fault.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.730
The document you prepared
was inadequate,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.250
that's why the client is angry.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.410
Yes.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.370
Why the pause?
You think it's my fault?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.570
I don't, but I wrote that
according to what you said...

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.770
Even so, correct it
if it's a mistake!

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.530
Our division doesn't need someone
who takes no initiative.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.950
Our company doesn't need one,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.990
and society itself
doesn't need one either!

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.670
Forget it. You should quit.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.130
Quit your job and quit being a man!
Just quit!

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.620
It feels much better.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.760
However, not many people can
go so far in real life.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.540
Why doesn't anyone do that, then?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.420
Because our ethics
tell us it's not good to kill?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.340
Or is it the moral values?
A sense of justice?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.380
Because our logical mind as a person
is functioning?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.300
The biggest reason is...

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.900
Because we don't want to
get arrested.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.860
Do you know what the relationship

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.380
between the murderers and
the victims in this country is?

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.500
"Relationship between
murderers and victims"

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.780
As you can see,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.580
about 90 percent of the victims
were killed by someone they knew.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.900
In other words,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.170
if you were killed by someone,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.680
there's a 90 percent chance

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.400
that it was by a family member,
someone you were seeing,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.250
a friend, or a colleague.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.290
For example...

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.450
You might be killed

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.650
by the person sitting next to you,
whom you're watching the telly with.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.580
That is why the police...

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.500
checks out
the victim's social network.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.700
That means...

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.820
Society itself
doesn't need one either!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.980
Forget it. You should quit.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.100
Quit your job and quit being a man!
Just quit!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.980
Just now, because I'm an outsider
and I have no motive,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.780
almost nobody would suspect me.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.900
Let's say you want to kill person A.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.430
If you aren't related to A
in any way,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.870
even if you kill A,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.110
the chance of you being arrested
is nearly zero.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.470
The above is only a theory.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.830
Who would've thought that

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.710
some people actually
try to carry out the theory?

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.470

Let's lean it back, then.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.280

- Yes.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.720

- I'll lean it back.
- Okay.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.800
Okay... Great.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.560

Please put it in front of
the bookshelf.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.960
- Where should I put it?
- In the bedroom, please.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.760

Yeah. Give me a year.

It <i>seems</i> that
the manager made it himself.

He made it himself?
That's impressive.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.070
He said he gives one to everyone who
moves in, and hung it there.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:34.150
I see.</i>

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.510
Well, our residents' association
will have a meeting later.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.630
I will introduce you to
the other residents.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.230
Residents' association?

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.590
Only one person per household
has to come.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.030
It's held once a month.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.470
It's too trivial to be held
once a month, though.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.870
Well, I'll see you later.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.390
Okay.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.490
I'll close my door.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.470
Excuse me.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.390
I'm Tezuka and we've moved in
to the flat opposite.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.150
Hello.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.230
"Room 304, Sora Kitagawa"

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.310
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.790
This is just to say hello.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.670
No, I don't live here.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.110
I am Kojima,
and I live in Room 102.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.150
"Room 102, Kayo Kojima"

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.630
See you, Sora.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.790
Bye.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.030
I'll give it to you, then.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.030
Thank you very much.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.590
You're upstanding!

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.470
We live opposite you,
so let's be friends.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.310
Okay!

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.470
Should we have given a gift
to the lady on the first floor?

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.590
- It was a bit awkward.
- Yeah.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.270
We don't know
how many people we should greet.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.270
Yeah.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.350
Is this broken? It doesn't ring.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.230
The flat there is unoccupied.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.350
"Room 501, Go Sano"

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.070
Thank you.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.310
My mind is exhausted!

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.270
No way! You can't be tired.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.070
Aren't you happy to
have more friends?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.750
I'm jealous of how tough you are.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:51.860
Anyway, have you realised something,
Detective Nana?

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.780
Don't call me that.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.540
Among the people we met, there was
something wrong with someone.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.310
But there's something wrong
with all of them.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.510
Be serious.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.710
Are we doing our usual thing?

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.990
Orangutan Time starts now!

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.070
But I am tired.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.070
Tell me, who was the weirdest
among the people we just met?

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.870
Well... The last man we met.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.190
Yes. Why was he weird?

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.470
The flat there is unoccupied.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.630
He was carrying a very large bag.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.450
No, not that.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.450
His boots.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.690
The flat there is unoccupied.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.970
It was sunny outside,
but he was wearing rain boots.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.250
Yes, I realised that too.
Why do you think?

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.010
Well...

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.210
Wait.
The residents' association meeting.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.330
We don't have to go.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.370
We have to.
First impression is important.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.770
But we haven't unpacked our stuff.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.930
Maybe I'll go.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.610
Only one person needs to go.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.650
Then...

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.610
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.050
All right.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.810
Ready? Rock, paper, scissors!

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.870
We think alike,
so it always ends in a draw

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.810
when we play rock-paper-scissors
and it makes me happy.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.450
My husband works as
a fitness trainer at a gym,

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.890
I am a designer and I work at home.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.130
Wow, you are a designer?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.170
"Room 101, Yuzuru Kuzumi"

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.410
Do you participate in fashion shows?

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.650
I design sports equipment, so I
don't participate in shows often.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.490
Who is a designer?

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.530
"Room 403, Atsushi Fujii"

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.490
Oh, it's the lady...

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.250
I am Tezuka, nice to meet you.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.070
She said her husband works as
a fitness trainer.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.310
Both you and your husband
have a job?

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.930
"Room 402, Sanae Enomoto"

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.430
The gentleman is your husband?

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.450
I assumed
he is your younger brother.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.490
Your age gap is so huge.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.160
I am 15 years older.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.600
By the way, they have no children.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.360
I've verified that
they have no pet too.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.320
People don't like the manager

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.400
checking their flat
on the very first day.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.250
But many married couples
that have no children keep cats!

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.930
Why do you have the prejudice?

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.970
"Room 304, Sumika Kitagawa"

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.650
By the way,
it was 37,800,800 yen, wasn't it?

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.970
Your flat!

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.130
It's been advertised many times,
so we all know. Right?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.970
Anyway, it has gotten a lot cheaper.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.850
Well, an accident happened there.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.850
"Room 201, Keisuke Ukita"

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.530
He is just joking!

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.050
Oh, Mr Ukita!

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.170
I was joking.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.440
It gets older every year,
so the price becomes lower too.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.760
But I was surprised that
the price got lower than 40 million.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.440
It means that
the money we have is getting less!

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.960
Exactly!

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.160
If there are so many bugs,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.520
what did you update it for, then?

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.520
"Room 404, Yuki Etou"

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.200
The meeting is going to start.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.570
I won't attend today.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:20.810
Oh, sorry about that.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.810
"Room 103, Junichiro Tamiya"

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:26.330
What caused it?

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:29.250
Sorry, I'm late.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.450
I am very sorry!

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.930
We won't start in three minutes.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.970
We should be here five minutes
earlier, but I'm two minutes late.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.090
I'm ashamed of myself.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.410
Never mind...

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.770
Chairlady, please start.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:40.850
Okay.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.490
13 residents are present
and five are absent. Is that okay?

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.290
Okay, let's start this month's
residents' association meeting.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.610
Thank you, everyone...

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.850
Let's see...

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.190
So... Regarding the person in charge
this year,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.850
we haven't appointed the person
in charge of cleaning last time,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.390
would anyone volunteer?

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.720
But isn't it the manager's job?

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.720
No.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.480
Someone is against
the raise of management fees!

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.000
That's why in exchange,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.560
you guys will clean
the rubbish dump!

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.730
- The majority agreed last time!
- Fine.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.770
"Fine"? The majority agreed...

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.330
Mr Tokoshima,
please speak a bit more softly.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:28.930
- Mr Tamiya...
- Mr Tokoshima.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.730
I don't know what the right amount
of management fee is,

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.250
so I won't judge anyone.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:42.770
But I think cleaning the place where
we live, by ourselves,

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.410
is a rudiment of day-to-day living.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.000
I think there are people
busy working every day,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.010
but why don't we clean
the rubbish dump ourselves?

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.970
You are right.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.480
Excuse me.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.600
What's the matter?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.970
What Tamiya said
was a bit too difficult.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.490
What did you say?

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.530
"Room 203, Xinyi"

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.450
Xinyi, when you talk to
someone older,

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.050
you'd better address them
more politely.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.200
Oh, is that so?

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.680
Sorry, mate.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.680
The way you apologise too...
Well, let's forget it.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.200
It's not too bad. I'm sorry.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.610
"Detective novels"

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.920
Miss Kinoshita.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.880
All right.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.800
Okay, Miss Kinoshita.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680
Mrs Tezuka.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.470
Miss Kinoshita.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.910
That's all.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.910
Okay, we've decided that
Room 401's Miss Kinoshita

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.470
will be in charge of cleaning.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:51.590
No objection.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:52.990
Excuse me.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:58.190
Miss Kinoshita didn't come today.
Is this okay?

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.060
Indeed.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.540
If she's got a problem,

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.740
complain to the seven people
who voted for her.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.500
I didn't vote for her.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.860
That means either Mr Tamiya
or Mrs Tezuka did.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.280
I voted for myself.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.760
Why not?

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.680
She's fussy about
sorting rubbish to begin with.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.320
Miss Kinoshita might be happy
to be in charge of cleaning.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.800
Well, she might open our big bags
to check them too.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.520
Right? You see?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.480
In other words, you'll just make
Miss Kinoshita do the job, right?

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.880
How can you say that?

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.320
What's wrong with you?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.600
Excuse me!

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.280
We've decided,
so let's stop our discussion.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.880
- See you, guys!
- See you...

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.080
Well then, let's have
our usual little chat.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.680
- Mrs Tezuka.
- Yes?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.680
The residents have a chat now,
as communication.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800
Do join them.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.040
Well, I...

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.320
Don't say no.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.840
People in charge of
money-collection and snacks,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.590
- please help.
- Okay...

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.030
I have to work.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.710
Ms Kitagawa, do stay behind
occasionally.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.510
Mrs Tezuka wants to talk to you too.
Okay?

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.990
Okay.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.960
Everyone,
Mrs Kitagawa will join too.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.880
- Have you done that?
- Yes, but...

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.160
Thank you.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.880
What is this?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.240
We collect money from all residents
for snacks.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.480
How much should I give?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.280
You are free to give
the amount you want,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.200
but if you give less than 1,000 yen,
someone will complain later.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.900
Guys, you're staring!

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.490
I see.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.050
Should I lend you?

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.620
Sorry, I will give you back later.
What is your flat number?

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.690
Next meeting will be fine.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:49.890
I am sorry.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.070
This is the amount you gave.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.710
Thank you so much.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.630
Have some.
We don't want any leftovers.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.870
Thank you.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.870
I'm Room 502's Akaike,
and I'm in charge of the snacks.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.110
Nice to meet you. I'm Tezuka.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.110
- You know...
- Yes?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.990
I can remember something I've heard.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:20.080
I have heard what your name is just
now, you don't have to repeat it.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.550
Okay.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.230
- Newcomer.
- Yes?

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.470
Do you want to kill me?

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.950
Pardon?

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.430
- Wait a second!
- You said that!

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.950
- What's the matter?
- This guy said...

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:45.290
that all the residents here hate me.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.530
He said you wanted to kill me
three minutes after you met me.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.790
It was only at first, but not now.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:54.430
That's why I asked the newcomer!

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.270
You're so noisy.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.190
So...

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.510
When we met just now,
did you want to kill me?

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.630
Don't be silly!

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.960
Why would she think so?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.350
It's fine.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.350
Because everyone has a moment
when they want to kill someone,

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.550
or just want the person dead, right?

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.670
No, I don't!

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.150
Usually people do! You do, right?

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.230
See? Nobody does!

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:26.030
But their reaction shows
that they do!

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.230
Either way,

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.200
why don't we change the topic?

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.840
Mr Tamiya, I hate people
who give fancy talk.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.920
I'm sure that everyone does!

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.690
If you mean I just want them gone
and isn't necessarily dead,

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:41.610
then I do.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.010
They're the same thing.
What are you talking about?

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.690
Hey, Fujii, you're the most likely
one to have one.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.590
I don't know why you said
I'm the most likely,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.190
but I was bullied
when I was in middle school.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.030
You want the bully dead?

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.550
Not just the bully,

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.430
I want all the people who pretended
they saw nothing gone too.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.600
You're so scary!

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.270
When I was still working, I was
always sexually harassed by my boss.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.870
I used to want that guy dead.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.000
I wanted him to die once,
come back to life,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.120
then die once more.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.200
Why would he want to
sexually harass Mrs Akaike?

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.160
Saying that is
sexual harassment too.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:19.960
Pardon?

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.120
He was too nervous
to harass the pretty ones,

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.120
that's why he harassed me.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.240
I see.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.160
Oh, I hate people who doesn't put
their wind chime away in autumn.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.000
The tinkle is so noisy.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.880
Right?

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.520
Indeed,

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:38.160
it makes you go crazy when it keeps
tinkling on a windy day.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.040
But would you kill someone for
something like this?

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.120
I want to,
if I wouldn't be arrested.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.350
But I would be arrested.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.830
But the police...

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.680
But the police first check
among the people the victim knows,

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.510
whether someone has a motive
to kill the victim or not.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.750
That's why even if it's trivial,
if you have a motive,

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.430
you'll end up being arrested.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.670
You know a lot.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.310
My husband and I
love mystery novels.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.510
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue"

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.270
"Detective Conan"

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.510
So, on the contrary, they won't find
out if we have no motive?

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.190
Don't kill someone without a motive!

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:21.950
I mean, for example,
if I ask a killer to kill you,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.800
but the killer and you
don't know each other.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.560
It's difficult to find out.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.550
Where can you find a killer?

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.430
And I think they're expensive.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.670
I'll do it.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.070
If you pay me.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:35.590
How much can make you do it?

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.910
10 million.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.590
- 10 million?
- It's too much!

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:41.390
In that case...

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.470
- What? You can pay 10 million?
- I can.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.680
That's how rich you'd expect
a doctor would be.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.400
I can, but I won't pay you.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.600
What is it, then?

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.040
You can kill
the person I hate instead.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.320
I will kill the person
you want to kill, in exchange.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.100
What the heck?

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.170
But keeping the secret would be difficult.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.470
Yes!
When knowing the victim and motive are removed,

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.410
creating a situation where murders
are mutually exchanged

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.550
will make it more difficult for secrets to leak out

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.710
Right?

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.850
It's murder-swap, right?

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.030
But the person I want to kill and I
don't know each other.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.940
You can kill them yourself?
That's good.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.660
Somehow our chat is
getting frightening.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.460
It is just an example.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.230
But now I'm curious about
what the person is like.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.550
Indeed.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:31.830
I can tell you, Mrs Tezuka,

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.830
if you tell me
whom you want to kill.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.750
- Me?
- I know.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.510
You don't seem to want to kill
anyone, that's why we asked.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.070
You look like
you wouldn't even kill a bug.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.270
Oh, of course I kill bugs.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.350
You love killing bugs, don't you?

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.750
I don't love it.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.860
Do you live on macarons?

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.100
I don't.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.470
Well, I want to ask who each one of
you want to kill, though.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:00.510
Okay.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.550
Why don't we reveal it together?

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.470
No! What do we do that for?

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.860
Frankly, you must be tired of
the Werewolf game.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.780
Indeed, I am executed by
the villagers every time.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.900
See? It's villager again!

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.540
So, for example,

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.140
we can write names on
ballot papers like just now

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.140
and show everyone without letting
anyone know who wrote it.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.380
Why do you have to go so far?

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.300
I don't want to show everyone.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.900
I will, if I'll show
only one person in secret.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.550
All right, then.
Why don't we do this?

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.430
Well, it's the box we just used.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.030
We'll write whom we want to kill...

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.630
If I don't participate,
maybe they'll talk behind my back.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:49.950
The other people besides me
seem to be bothered by that too.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.430
Don't look at other people's paper.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:58.760
One, two, three, four, five.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:05.530
One, two, three, four, five.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:06.530
Yours.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.090
There you go.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.210
Yours.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.690
Please write the name.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.110
Excuse me...

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.510
I think we'd better not do this.

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.590
This is just a game.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:26.870
Or is there someone
that you really want to kill?

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.420
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.860
May I borrow a pen?

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.820
Sure.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.660
- There you go.
- Thank you.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.520
Everyone, put the piece of paper
in the tin after you've finished.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.630
Okay, as we said just now,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:10.790
we'll do it like exchanging gifts
at the Christmas party.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.110
- Okay.
- Good.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:16.310
There you go.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.200
It's said that
what is left behind brings you luck.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.480
Thank you.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.080
Do not show other people.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.240
Well then...

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.000
Open it!

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.120
Although it's a game,

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.160
it's the first time I see
words written...

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.760
when someone was thinking about
wanting to kill another person.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:08.750
I'm sure...

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.560
"Takafumi Kono"

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.160
that this person has no idea...

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.340
that someone wants to kill him.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:27.490
Welcome home!

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.810
I am home!

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.650
Wow, you've tidied it up! Thank you.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.250
Okay. How did it go?

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:37.450
Nothing in particular.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.970
I see.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.730
- Thanks for attending it.
- Don't worry about it.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.170
In that case,

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.930
will we submit this later?

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.730
"Marriage registration form"

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.610
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.890
Your reply is not serious!

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:52.810
I'm sorry.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.080
You said you wanted to submit it
after we move here.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.080
Does our age gap still bother you?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.880
Having a 15 year age gap
is quite common.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.760
Quite common is exaggerating it.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.240
I want to tell everyone properly
that we are married too.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.340
You see, I feel a bit like I'm lying
to our neighbours now.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.820
I am a bit scared.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.140
Just a bit.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.300
I feel that you are
very close to me, Shota,

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.940
I feel that you've gotten a lot
closer to me than when we first met.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.300
But our age gap can never be filled.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.460
There will be a 15 year gap
between us forever.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.660
The fact that
we can never fill it...

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.700
makes me scared somehow.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.900
Oh, why are you scared?

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.940
I don't know.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.380
Maybe I am not scared,

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.540
I just feel a little lonely.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.250
In the coming 15 years in your life,

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.640
you will grow up and
your sense of values will change.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.880
When you are about as old
as I am now,

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.520
will you still love me?

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.660
I have the same worries too,
because you're also going to change.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.700
I am too old to change.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.230
That's not the case.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.470
Sorry for bringing this up.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.590
Look at the setting sun!

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.230
It's gorgeous!

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.910
Come on, let's go outside.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.870
I'm glad that we bought it.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.140
You said it the second time today.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.350
About what we were saying
just now...

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.060
I want to grow to become
a more reliable person.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:10.060
So I'm going to grow
and I'm going to change.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:15.250
And I think you are still going to
grow and change too.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.370
But even if we both change

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.330
and become someone
different from who we are now,

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:23.730
I will still fall in love with you.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.010
Don't worry.

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.670
We'll change many times,

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.710
we'll like each other
after we have changed,

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:35.870
and we will fall in love
with each other again and again.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:45.590
So don't get worried and let's go to
register our marriage.

And...

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.180
Yes?

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.300
What will we have for supper?

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.460
I'll make something.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.140
That's right.
We have to buy some groceries.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.500
I'll go with you.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.780
It's okay, you went to buy lunch.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.380
Keep training
your internal oblique muscle.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.300
Oh? You remember it now?

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.740
Wait, where is my coat?

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.550
Your coat is probably there.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:28.510
- There?
- No... Wait. Is it there?

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.390
- Did I put it there?
- No, it's fine.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.230
What?

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.470
Oh, hello.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.470
- The manager said that, right?
- Yes.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.910
But I'm not bothered by it.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.350
Glad to hear that.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.390
He also said that to me
when I first moved here,

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.150
that many childless couples
keep cats.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.270
Oh, it's only me and my husband too.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.380
I see.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:45.110
Well, I think the manager
doesn't think before he speaks.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.270
True.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:52.940
That's why I thought I shouldn't let
everything he says hurt my feelings.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:00.900
Every time someone says
something awful to me,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.110
I say something nice
to somebody twice.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.630
I am practising this,

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.070
so that I can make
the kindness in the world...

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:16.380
Well, increase little by little.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.420
Is this weird?

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.670
No, I think your idea is wonderful.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:25.830
Thank you.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:30.070

It's Nana.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.790
Nana, right?
You can call me Sanae-chan.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.750
Oh, let me call you Sanae.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.950

She went to work again.

Yeah?

I found his contact details.
Maybe we can give it back tomorrow?

But wouldn't he be
worrying about them?

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.030
Are they the keys of his office?

The door was open, I wanted to
lock it, but none of them fits.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.470
Maybe they're his home's keys?

But this looks like a car
or a motorcycle key.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:35.230
Anyway, let's call him.

No.

I can't really explain it,

but the other residents
have trouble dealing with him too.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.950
To be honest, everyone hates him.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:00.870

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.630
What? He left his mobile here too?

He did?
