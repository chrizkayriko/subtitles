WEBVTT

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.140
On the first day we moved here,</i>

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.100
the residents played a murder-swap
game without me realising it.</i>

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.300
"Caretaker, Yutaro Yamagiwa"

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.060
lt's easier than doing surgery.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.300
Every time a person dies,</i>

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.300
someone threatens
and someone else is threatened.</i>

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.580
Mrs Akaike!

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.940
Another murder happens...</i>

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.020
Mrs Akaike!

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.220
Julia!

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.940
During our investigation,</i>

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.590
we realised that murders not related
to the game could have happened...</i>

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.460
Nana!

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.150
Even so, l have no time to be sad.</i>

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.040
It's the last time, please smile.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.340
Shota, l...

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
There is something
that l have to do now.</i>

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.940
If you had reported the murder-swap
game to the other detectives,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.260
then Nana didn't have to die!

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.510
Potassium chloride caused her death.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.200
We haven't got much data now,
but if we let the Al analyse it,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.950
it'll say Fujii is the murderer.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.120
It's trespassing!

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.470
Call the police, then.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.110
Photos of the suspects of actor

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.070
Yoshihiko Hakamada's murder
have been released.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.990
The wanted men are
an Iranian man, Ali Moharrami...

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.880
Shota, call back at once
when you hear my message.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.600
Let go! Hey!

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.270
Mr Fujii!

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.840
Wait, what are you doing?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880
Did you kill him? Hang on...

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.590
Aren't you just carrying him?

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.960
Wait, what will you do?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.270
Let go...

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.200
lt's so troublesome.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.920
Nikaido?

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.620
What's going on?

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.180
What?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.790
What is... this...

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.100
What are you doing?

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.350
Are you okay?

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.860
Mr Yomogida, thank you!

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.800
No, l... Don't worry about it.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.160
Doyan, what are you doing?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.030
Will you call the police?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920
Sure...

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.880
Hello, l was suddenly attacked
by two foreigners. Yes...

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.520
Two men. Well, l'm all right now.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.820
Is there any other way
to settle this?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.230
No. The police will definitely
come here too.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.660
Flee now. We'll think about
what we should do later.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.690
Okay.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.170
I'll see what's going on outside.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.530
We're going to meet again,
aren't we?

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.130
We will. We can. We can!

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.690
Starting today, l'll sleep
at 1:00 am every day.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.290
Sleep at the same time as me, Xinyi.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.770
Let's meet in our dreams for now.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.630
I'm going to feel lonely.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.670
Don't worry.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.510
There's a legend in Vietnam
that says

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.080
if you fly in the sky
on Tom Hap Nuoc Dua in your dream,

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.550
then you can get married.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.200
"Tom Hap Nuoc Dua"?

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.430
Let's have the same dream
at the same time.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.160
- Tom Hap...
- Can l kiss you?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.750
I don't want a kiss that feels like
we'll never meet again!

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.030
Kiss me like you're just going to
the convenience store.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.250
See you...

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.410
"Sumida Police Station"

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.650
You attacked Shota Tezuka,

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.110
attempted to kidnap him,
on top of that...

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.410
Why did you kill Yoshihiko Hakamada?

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.740
- Mr Mizuki.
- What?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.710
Is this okay? The case is handled
by another police station.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.880
That's why l'll ask
before he is sent there.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.050
I don't like Hakamada's face,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.640
so l killed him.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.920
I don't like Hakamada's face,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.980
so l killed him.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.650
They obviously agreed
to say the same thing.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.930
There is another person besides
the other man we caught, right?

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.770
The footwear impressions...
Well, footprints.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.130
Three people's footprints
were left at the crime scene.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.730
We only haven't found who the 24.5
centimetres long one belongs to.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.730
It's hers, isn't it?

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.770
No!

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.420
- I know you want to cover for...
- lt really isn't hers!

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.140
I told you, l don't know anything.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.740
The two men saw Mr Tezuka
and they suddenly...

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.340
Mr Tezuka said he saw a large amount
of drugs at your home.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.700
They were just medicine.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.340
Xinyi asked me to send some to
her home's village, so l got them.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.610
Then the men came to take them.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.690
The condo is awful!
Too many murders happened.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.010
Maybe it's cursed.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.450
You think so too?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.280
How can it be cursed?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.000
No, l'm sorry. You are right.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.040
The reason that many people died
at the condo...

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.860
is because they're playing
a murder-swap game.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.050
What game?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.540
Ask Mr Kamiya. He knows the details.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.460
What do you mean? l don't get it.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.540
Murder-Swap Game?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.020
It's a free app, but in the end,
you have to spend money to win.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.580
There are many apps
like this lately.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.620
Forget it.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.900
I can't trust you anymore.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.300
Calm down...

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.860
Are you free now?

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.780
I'm going to tell you
a pretty long story now.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.420
Sure.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.900
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.700
l can't forgive them.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.660
Sora, it's been a while.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.370
This is normal!

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.650
When is this going to stop?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.800
It's about Kuroshima.
Something isn't right about her.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.850
What isn't?

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.890
What is this all about? Hey!
How long have you known?

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.930
I don't remember so precisely.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.050
You're defiant now?

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.580
- Mr Mizuki, it's your fault.
- What?

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.620
If you knew that the residents
killed each other in a game,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.420
you'd say it was scary
and it was a curse, right?

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.380
I can't stand it anymore!

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.220
You frighten me most now.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.380
It's a misunderstanding.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.980
I... l am really sorry.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.180
- If possible, please don't...
- Report it yourself.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.500
Everything. Honestly.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.480
Depending on what you report,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.300
l'll decide whether l will
trust you or not in the future.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.020
Yes, sir.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:03.220
The suspects of Yoshihiko Hakamada's
murder have finally been arrested.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.410
The repertory cinema in lidabashi

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.810
is holding
a memorial all-night film screening

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.660
titled "Really Amazing,
Yoshihiko Hakamada."

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.770
Our programme will give out tickets
to four pairs of our audience.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.340
Mummy, l am hungry.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.900
- What do you want to have?
- Curry!

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.460
Curry? Let's go to the place
near our home

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.260
where we went the other day .

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.100
- It was delicious!
- Let's go there.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.500
Let's go there!

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.050
I am so confused.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.460
When is this going to stop?

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.290
You were too reckless.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.570
It's pointless to use Al
if you do that.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.850
- Kuroshima.
- Yes?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.170
Oh, Doyan too.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.650
Sorry l made you worried,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.330
but this might continue to happen.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:07.690
What...

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.170
So far, every time
l did something reckless...

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.130
l am sorry.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.330
Shota...

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.820
We made progress
in investigating the case.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.770
- But still...
- Moreover,

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.930
when they put a bag over my head

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.860
and beat me up...

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.060
l thought, "l'm going to be killed,"
and l was terrified.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.580
At that time...

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.620
l thought maybe this was
how frightened Nana was too.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:45.740
Shota...

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.020
So l can't forgive them.
l swear, l won't forgive them!

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.340
Will you talk about something else?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.780
You do something reckless when
you're beside yourself with anger.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.660
I've input the data into the Al,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.780
so l want some other data.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.100
Okay.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.220
Didn't you say you were blindfolded?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.140
Yes.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.900
Under a similar situation,
did it remind you of anything?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.380
Like the voice of
the third person in the room.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.220
I make my decisions quickly.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.900
No, l don't know.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.340
But at least it wasn't
the two foreigners.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.140
It wasn't Mr Fujii too.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.950
Please sort your rubbish properly
and just act sensibly.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.830
Oh, Mr Sano! l'll introduce you.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.560
Your new neighbour...
Wait! You ignore me?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.630
We don't get along, do we?

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.670
Wait... Hang on!

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.400
Oh?

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.220
What? l was going to say hello
and give him the gift.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.940
- He won't accept it anyway.
- Why?

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.340
Somehow his looks and curly hair
are the only decent things he has,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.740
he's unsociable.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.180
What's 501's resident called?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.800
Oh, it's Sano.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.280
A guy? How old is he?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.340
Yes, a guy, but l don't know
how old he is.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.720
No? Will you introduce me
to everyone here?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.400
In that case, an urgent residents'
meeting will be held later.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.470
Will people involved in the murder
be there?

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.870
Yeah, probably.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.350
Good! l'll attend, then.
lt's for you.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.350
Wow, thanks!

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.910
- So... which way?
- This way.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.990
Let's go.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.470
- It's really tasty.
- Yeah?

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.310
"Murder-Swap Game
at Kuramae Condo"

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.230
Why did they play this game?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.070
It seems to be entertainment
after their residents' meeting.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.070
Why did so many people die, then?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.630
This isn't right!

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.910
The table is just a summary of
the information Tezuka gave me,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.470
- l don't know the details.
- Kamiya.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.470
Yes?

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.190
If you don't know the details,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.830
is there anything
that you don't feel right?

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.550
Well, for example,

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.510
Kuzumi wrote Yoshihiko Hakamada
as the person he wanted to kill,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.110
and two men staying with Xinyi were
arrested as the murder suspects.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.710
They have no motive to kill
Hakamada.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.550
If there was trouble
between the residents,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.710
we can still guess the motive.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.710
They're foreigners who've overstayed
and an actor, respectively.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.590
If anything,

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.270
it's more likely that
they're really playing the game.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.910
The matter is quite horrible
and l can't believe it right away,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.390
but let's bear this in mind
and use it for our investigation.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.510
Yes, sir.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.910
What? We will really do it?

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.150
Yes, we do it annually,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.150
and we did nothing suspicious.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.650
Suspicious, huh?

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.880
We run a stall every year at our
neighbourhood group's festival.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.200
But isn't it bad
to run a stall at this time?

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.560
What do you mean?

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.640
You want to say that
nobody will come

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.720
to a stall run by
the murderers' condo, right?

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.080
Yes, indeed,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.920
but Mr Ukita gave it his all
every year before,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.980
so l'll help too.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.550
We might as well
make a haunted house!

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.910
We'll pretend to be killers
and scare people.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:53.470
It sounds fun!
The real one is among us too.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.950
What are you talking about?

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.370
So, what did this girl say
about the men who stay with her?

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.150
She said she had met them,
but she didn't know them well.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.220
However, when we inspected her flat,
we thought she must know them.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.610
There were beds for four people.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.370
And pillows for seven people.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:25.770
Among them, the most likely
third suspect of Hakamada's murder

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.370
was Xinyi, but...

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.410
On the day of the murder,

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.740
Xinyi had an interview in Tokyo
for a part-time job.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.880
The man, Cuong,
accompanied her there.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.680
She has an alibi?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.080
And this guy was working
at his office too?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160
We've sent lqbal home.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.240
Many points in Xinyi's statement
are unknown,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.280
so we're still investigating.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.760
We haven't found the third murderer
in Hakamada's murder?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.120
"List of residents
at Chiunque Kuramae"

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.280
Let's talk about
the summer festival later,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.160
and we'll drop this for now.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.840
- Mr Yomogida.
- Hello.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.040
I'll introduce you all
to your new neighbour.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.560
He has moved in
and you can't say no this time.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.280
- What?
- Well then...

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.680
- Come in.
- Thanks.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.720
Well...

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.550
l'm Minami and l've move in to
Room 502. Nice to meet you.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.110
502?

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.470
The Akaike family's...

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.690
Mrs Akaike!

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.210
It's terrifying, isn't it?

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.410
It's unusual, isn't it?
But the rent is cheap.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.810
Is that why you think
it isn't normal? But it is normal!

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.090
Don't worry!

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.210
One, two, three... All of you have
a questioning look on your faces!

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.330
Well, guys, be friends with him.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.530
- Do sit down.
- Thanks.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.050
Let's vote to see
how many are against him moving in!

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.430
Wait, ma'am.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.160
And neighbours.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.640
Don't look at me like that.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.280
So many things happened
in this condo,

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.960
so l should be the one to... Right?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.720
You should be the one to what?

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.840
To close the distance between us

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.520
and build
a mutual trust relationship.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.010
Yeah. That.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.980
So, will you tell me your names?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.280
Let's start from me.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.160
Room 204's Nishimura.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.240
- Mr Nishimura.
- Yes.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.480
And your housemate was killed?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.720
No, not me.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.030
What? We'll start from those
whose housemate was killed.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.270
Are you a reporter or what?

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.910
I am not.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.350
So, who are you? Tell me your name
and the murdered...

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.550
You jerk!

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.830
Room 302. Shota Tezuka.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.710
My wife, Nana Tezuka, was killed.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.280
The murderer hasn't been caught.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.040
Well...

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.110
l hope they will be caught soon,
Mr Tezuka.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.520
Yes.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.540
Think about what you want to put
at the stall until next time.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.980
- Okay...
- Thank you.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.260
Mr Tezuka.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.030
You can't.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.230
What?

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.870

But l made lots of effort
to collect them.

Doyan, let's go.

Your job?

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.510
Wait, what are you doing?

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.950
I'm taking my revenge.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.390
Let's go.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.430
Are you okay?

Yes. Thank you.
Well, regarding that...

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.320
l am home.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.840

the real thing

is three days later.

No need to say that twice.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.630
Well then, do your best.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.520
Hello!

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.680
Sorry, l'd like to check the lines
with you before the performance.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.870
Sure. lt's important.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.840
It's where he asks for the bill?

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.540
Yes, just a bit before that...

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.160
Bon appetit.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.640
It's so darn hot,
but you make hot pot every time.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.590
Bon appetit.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.430
You don't say anything
and just eat now.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:01.270
It's only the look on your face.
Look like you enjoy it more.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:02.670
It tastes good,

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.310
but my tongue and my face
have different personalities.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.750
Oh.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.630
What will you do about Mr Fujii?

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.510
I told the police about the game, so
l'll wait for them to take action.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.510
Also, there is too little data
about Miss Ono.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.390
She stubbornly refused
to tell me about the names.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.670
I had pretended to want to
tell the same story as her

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.590
and went to her flat.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.670
But l didn't find anything fishy.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.150
Filling the table is the shortcut
to solving the case, but...

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.830
Sanae lied about what she wrote,

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.310
and l'm thinking about
asking the police

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.510
to analyse the fingerprints
on Mrs lshizaki's paper.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.110
Another question is
Mrs Misato Akaike.

"502, Akaike"

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.870
And the names drawn by Mr Tamiya
and Kuroshima.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.830
Well, there's something about
Kuroshima.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.600
It's been bothering me.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.040
What is it?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.190
Her... you know...

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.280
Her smell is weird.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.430
- Smell?
- Yes.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.350
I really hate other people's smells.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.350
So l spray room deodoriser,
even after you leave too.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.750
But only her smell
doesn't bother me.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.430
What are you talking about?

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.190
This is important!

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.710
I'm going to input this data
into the Al.

so her diet can be deduced.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.260
For example, you know
that someone eats curry a lot

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.480
if you can verify the spices on some
fibres left at the crime scene...

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.900
lt can be connected like this.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.310
I see.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.390
Yes.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.990
But judging by what you just said,
probably it's because...

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.230
You're in love.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.110
In love?

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.270
Doyan, you're in love
with Kuroshima,

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.710
- so it doesn't bother you.
- What?

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:05.150
Well, for example,

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.550
dogs smell another dog's butt

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.950
to judge whether it's
a friend or enemy.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.270
Their smell changes
when they are in heat too.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.390
If you find someone's smell
acceptable, it's out of instinct.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.470
Oh...

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.710
l loved Nana's smell very much too.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.310
When l hug her,

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:32.510
l always smell
a light, pleasant smell.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.550
It would make me think,
"Oh, this is Nana.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.220
I feel so blessed."

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.520
No matter how many times l hug her,
l still want to hug her even more.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.900
Even now, when l smell her smell,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.460
it reminds me of
her smile and gestures.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.270
They just come to my mind.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:05.470
So, when Nana's smell
gradually disappears from the flat,

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:07.590
it makes me scared.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.270
I still can't open the wardrobe yet.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.750
So, Doyan...

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.310
it is very lucky to meet
someone like this.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.000
"Goodbye Rhapsody"

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.560
So you released her?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.040
We know clearly the time
that Yoshihiko Hakamada was killed.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.560
If she has an alibi,
we can't continue to question her.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.990
Cuong called. He's all right.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.670
Don't worry.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.360
It's all my fault.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.960
I found Yoshihiko Hakamada's
schedule.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.790
Amazing.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.160
Are you really going to do it?

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.860
This is the chance
to repay Xinyi's kindness.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.910
We did it ourselves.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.790
It isn't your fault, Xinyi.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.200
"Goodbye Rhapsody"

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.480
We really are going to break up
for real?

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.680
Yes.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.550
Instead of forcing ourselves
to be friends,

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.040
we should make more effort
on something else.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.160
Effort? Don't say it like that.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.700
Excuse me, the bill, please.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.800
Certainly, sir. The bill.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.720
When he says "the bill,"
l dance towards the dining area,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.040
reacting to the curse that my body
became familiar with before l knew.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.320
It's the same when someone says,
"Some beer first."

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.160
Flying orders, dancing steps!

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.120
Days repeat themselves,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.040
the wage is low.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.440
No matter how many seasons come and
go, they never lose their beauty.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.680
But every time
my life repeats itself...

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.680
it gets duller.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.740
Mr Tamiya...

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.450
You came! Thank you.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.460
- It was interesting.
- Really?

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.420
You were acting in
a dimension different from them.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.500
Those who really see it can tell.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.730
Can l have an autograph?

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.100
Come on! Don't tease me.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.610
Have you got a pen?

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.740
Your autograph,

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.980
and l'd like to see the video taken
by the security cameras you set.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.180
I heard that you set them up.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.760
I don't know how to handle machines,
so nothing was taken.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.520
But you only need to press a button.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.690
Why? l said you didn't have to come!

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.900
I was so nervous!

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.420
Half-way through it,
maybe l was possessed by something,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.420
l don't remember anything
after he said, "The bill, please."

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.340
lt wasn't scripted.
l guess l entered "the zone"...

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.270
Check the alibi of each person
in the murder cases so far again.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.750
Also, check if anyone close to them
is involved in a murder too.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.870
That's all.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:11.830
Yes, sir.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.670
You're so fishy that
l don't want to be your partner.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.550
How can you doubt
a fellow detective?

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:22.710
Where are you going?

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.390
I'll try to start attacking
from the weakest one.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.070
"Murder-swap game"?

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.070
- You did it, right?
- Yes.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.810
Our chairlady told us that
it has been reported to the police.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.850
We talked about it
at the residents' meeting.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.770
A series of murders
continued to happen

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.850
as if they were related to the game,

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.530
but they aren't related.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.530
According to the information we got,

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.650
you wrote Yutaro Yamagiwa's name,

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:59.970
Sanae drew the piece of paper,
and she killed Yamagiwa.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.610
That's what we've got.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:03.690
Is that correct?

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.730
Hang on.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.130
Yes, l did write Yamagiwa's name,

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.330
l admit it.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.970
Everyone talked. Talked...

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.090
lt's weird to say so, huh?
Oops, l spat. lt's so dirty.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.720
After Sanae Enomoto killed Yamagiwa,
she threatened you.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.840
You yielded to her threat,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.880
so you killed Masao Tanaka,

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.520
the owner of a Bhutanese diner
in the neighbourhood.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.840
After that, you threatened
Room 203's Xinyi.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.880
Am l right so far?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.680
You got one thing wrong.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.880
I did not kill the diner's owner.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.310
So you admit that
you threatened Xinyi?

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.990
You got two things wrong.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.230
Xinyi...

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:49.430
On a bath towel
we found at Sanae Enomoto's home,

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.650
we found DNA that didn't belong
to the Enomoto family.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.630
May we take a sample of your DNA
just in case?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.310
This is your bath towel.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:06.950
Your DNA and Yutaro Yamagiwa's DNA
will be found on it.

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.550
May l stand up?

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.350
Okay, l give up.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.550
I'll say everything honestly.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.070
I wrote Yamagiwa's name.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.870
Then, Yamagiwa was killed.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:47.150
For some reason, when l went home,
his head was in my washing machine.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.790
I was shocked,
so l dashed out of my flat.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.110
But when l returned,
the head was gone.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.430
The door was locked
when you came home, right?

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.350
Yes.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:05.340
The question is how she broke into
the flat and took the head back.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:06.910
Yeah.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.150
The key...

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.480
"Master key"

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.960
After that,

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.000
l yielded to an incredible number
of extremely evil threats,

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.160
and l had no choice
but to unwillingly...

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.120
The diner owner.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.440
The diner owner...

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.240
Sorry, sir, please...

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.760
idiot! Come in later!

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.400
No, sir! Now...

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.420
What? He has an alibi?

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.260
Fujii was working the night shift
at the time Masao Tanaka died,

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.900
and he was treating
an emergency patient.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.710
Sorry about
the various things we did.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.710
Seven,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.270
eight...

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:59.470
nine...

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.110
ten.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:03.950
Okay, well done.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.070
Let's do one more set.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:07.990
- Excuse me.
- Okay, let's do it.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.790
- Excuse me!
- One...

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.950
l've done 12 sets.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.550
My arms are killing me.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:16.590
Sorry, l've been thinking...

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.230
What? 12 sets?

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.310
Yes.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.950
You should've told me earlier!

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.670
Your arms break
if you do three sets of this!

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.390
Your muscles are
surprisingly strong.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.750
I do physical work in a sense.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.150
I am very sorry.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.470
Sora.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.990
We'll have shiitake mushrooms.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.390
What?

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.190
Shiitake mushroom hamburger steak.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.630
- Hamburger steak?
- Yes.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.630
- Yes!
- Good. Let's go.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.670
- Well...
- l want to buy some snacks.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:52.710
- Snacks?
- l'll go and have a look.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.310
- Be careful.
- Okay.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.540
Sora.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.160
It's been a while.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.110
You can come out now?

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.230
Yeah.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.550
"Room 402, Soichi Enomoto"

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.870
l successfully escaped.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.200
Glad to hear that.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.200
Sorry that l scared you
at that time.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.560
It's okay.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.840
Sora?

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.440
Sora.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:40.940
Sora?

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.180
Sora?

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.300
Sora?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.760
Sora?

Sora!

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.990
Gosh! l thought you went
to the snacks aisle?

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.190
Yeah, but...

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.870
But what?

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.790
Nothing.

"Sumida Police Station"

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.750
l'll ask again.

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:25.710
How did you put Yamagiwa's head
into Fujii's washing machine

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.070
and take it back?

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:31.310
Aren't your eyes dry?

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.710
Well, in the usual case,

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.870
it's either you,
or your husband, Masashi, or...

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.350
Oh, it was me.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.550
I did it. l did everything.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.390
I'll tell you in that order.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.310
First, about Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.630
The hospital is famous,
so l knew where it was.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.390
So l waited until he left.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.390
After that, l drove
for about 30 minutes in Tokyo...

lt really says that
l was seeing a patient.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.830
You've been taking
many half days lately.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.990
Yeah, a bit.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:17.550
Have you been questioned
by the police?

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:19.510
Why?

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.850
The police has contacted us.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:23.850
For what?

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.810
No idea. Ask the director.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:29.370
However,

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:34.570
they asked whether you came to work
or not on 30th April,

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.790
so l gave them the record.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.210
- On that day, l...
- Yes.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.290
So l think the director
will be angry at you.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.330
You weren't supposed to be on duty,
but you saw a patient.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:48.690
No, l...

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.250
Doctor,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.970
you saw a patient on that day.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.170
Did you alter the record?

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.970
Don't ask. lt's annoying.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.250
First,

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:09.690
tell me honestly
what you did on that day.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.050
Come on! Tell me now!

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:15.400
You actually want to
tell someone everything

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.280
and get it off your chest, right?

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.400
So tell me.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.840
On that day, l...

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.120
l sneaked
into the Bhutanese diner...

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.320
and killed Masao Tanaka.

"Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital"

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.120

- l know. l'm sorry.

- You know? You haven't got it.
- But it's...

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.350
The bag...

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.330
lt can't possibly be in the bag!

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.180
I said sorry.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.740
You're Mr Ukita's...

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.860
So you've visited him many times?

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.020
Yeah, dad...

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.900
Mr Ukita...

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.260
seemed to have met him
right before he died.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.300
So we thought he must know something

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.820
and came to see how he's doing
from time to time.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.100
Either that,

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.620
or this Yoshihiko Hakamada
look-alike killed Mr Ukita.

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.780
It doesn't make sense that
he fell down an escalator!

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.460
No, it was an elevator.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.780
It was escalator.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.020
No, it was an elevator.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.710
- What?
- An elevator.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.550
No, it's the box thing, right?

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.810
Are you serious?

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.160
You lost your wife too, right?

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.620
Are you okay with this?

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.500
Of course you can't be okay.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.260
I want to find the murderer
and kill them.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.300
Mr Ukita was strangled
and he died a horrible death,

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.140
but despite that,
he had a smile on his face.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.300
Seeing that made me even sadder.

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.580
What?

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:09.260
In detail!

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.500
In detail!

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.060
He was smiling?

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.300
So it seems.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.420
I remember that Nana too...

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.700
l thought it was because
the drug didn't make her suffer,

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.580
but l just remembered something.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.740
Mr and Mrs Akaike were smiling too.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.100
What a strange coincidence.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.740
The murder happened in...

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.980
Room 502.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.250
I want to see it.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.410
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.890
Please come in!
You're my first visitors.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.690
Wow, l'm so happy.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:48.970
Sorry, we know this is rude...

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.370
lt's okay. lt's natural that you
want to check out various things.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.530
Even the cleaning service staff
couldn't remove it.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.530
Well, stuff like this
doesn't bother me.

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.930
Have you found any clues?

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.900
- No.
- l'll ask one thing, then.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.060
Do you know where
Mrs Sachiko Akaike is?

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.530
Julia!

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:45.010
Well, l rent this flat cheaply,
so l want to say thank you,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.850
but l still haven't met
the old lady herself.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.730
I don't really know.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.730
As l thought, he is weird.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.090
People who move here now
are all weirdos.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.930
We didn't get anything here.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.010
I'll go see the old lady tomorrow.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:18.370
Okay.

"International Science
and Engineering University"

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.210
Mr Nikaido.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:57.890
Are you going home?
Shall we go together?

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.760
It's fine, but...

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.050
What's the matter?

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.290
If we have nothing to talk about
on the way

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.130
and there is an uncomfortable
silence, l can't deal with it.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.370
If you promise you won't talk to me
at all, then l'll go with you.

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.890
Sure.

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.330
Then let's say nothing
when we walk home.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:43.890
There she is.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:44.930
Hello.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.690
Mrs Akaike,
can you see the Ferris wheel?

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:53.370
Her relatives haven't been here
since they sent her here,

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.410
so l come here.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.570
Does Sachiko remember the case...

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.290
Don't.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.410
She recalled it the other day
and she was confused.

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:09.650
Lately, l, Sumika Kitagawa,

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.290
have been looking for cooling sounds
in summer,

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.610
like the murmur of a stream
or a ringing wind chime,

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:22.690
to try to get over this hot summer.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.770
Yeah.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:28.330
Okay, l'll read out
a few messages sent to us...

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.750
"Let's go to the festival together"

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.610
Soichi. Are you going somewhere?

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.450
Yes, l am going
to my friend's place.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.530
- You've made friends?
- Yes.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.100
But please hang out
with me too, Sawa.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.020
Sure.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.130

Mrs Akaike, do you remember me?

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.210
Are you the same?

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:40.170
You mean Nana?

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.250
The boy.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.740
Who do you mean?

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.950
He praised me and said it suited me.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.520
Why did he praise you?

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.110
It's that. You know, that.
Don't you know?

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.630
You should be educated.
