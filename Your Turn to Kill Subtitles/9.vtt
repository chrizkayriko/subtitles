00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.070
"Everyone must have someone
they want to kill."</i>

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.510
l think this is what started it.</i>

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.790
We wrote the names of the people
we want to kill</i>

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.560
and showed each other secretly.</i>

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.160
Right after that...</i>

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.680
The name l wrote
was Yutaro Yamagiwa.<i></i>

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.760
I had no idea
that he'd really be killed.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.360
I wrote Misato Akaike.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.560
I wrote Yoshihiko Hakamada
on the piece of paper.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.440
The name l wrote on the piece
of paper was Mrs Kayo Kojima.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.800
People are murdered one after the next.</i>

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.680
The man whose name l wrote also...</i>

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.240
l don't want to die
when she still hates me.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.370
We should tell the police.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.940
I found out a certain fact
about the game.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580
But please keep it a secret
from Mr Enomoto.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.940
Mr Enomoto didn't participate
in the game,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.580
if he was doing something...

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.980
He did it for Sanae.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.980
It is true that l lied.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.060
We also do what we do out of love.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.980
And...</i>

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.480
l wrote the name of my subordinate,
his name is Takafumi Kono.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.680
The man whose name is on
the piece of paper l drew also...</i>

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.840
Don't really attack me.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.680
Mr Kono!

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.640
Okay, that's all.
Thanks for your cooperation.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.480
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.910
- Mr Kamiya.
- Yes?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.520
Please solve this case
as quickly as you can.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.200
Of course.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.760
Excuse me.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.510
- What about me?
- Don't know.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.630
I feel so hurt!

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.310
The man didn't kill Kono, did he?

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.870
Even so, too many people
around him died.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.310
I'll hurry to check the CCTVs
in the area.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.550
Shota!

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.550
l've just finished, too.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.960
Nana!

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.240
I said nothing about the game
just in case.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.560
But is that all right?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.270
"Takafumi Kono"

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.870
lt's supposed to be the name l drew.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.590
But someone else killed him.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.430
If it's in that order,

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.750
the one that would threaten me
to kill him should be Mr Kuzumi,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.610
but he is hospitalised
and unconscious.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.310
This isn't a murder-swap anymore,
right?

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.000
If so, was Mr Kono's murder
a coincidence?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.160
Like, the murderer disguised it
as a murder-swap?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.920
People besides us who could find out
about Mr Kono were...

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.200
Mr Tamiya himself,

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920
Sanae,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.440
and Kuroshima.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.560
I don't want to suspect anyone.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.120
Well, let's say, l'm the murderer.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.200
To kill Mr Kono right after
l find out about him

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.000
would be too obvious, so l wouldn't.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.560
Does Mr Tamiya know
about Mr Kono's death?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.560
I think he's been informed.
lt's on the news, too.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.520
Until Mr Tamiya says anything to us,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.560
l think we should feign ignorance.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.870
We have no idea
who did this and why,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.550
maybe we should be more careful.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.710
Let's not tell Sanae
and Kuroshima either.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.440
The victim was a bank worker
Mr Takafumi Kono, 26 years old,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840
who worked at Aoi Bank's
Sumida branch,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.350
which is 200 metres away from here.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.830
Mr Kono was sent to hospital,

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.750
but bled to death afterwards...

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.740
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.880
"Episode 9"

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.720
Also...

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.160
Thanks.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.160
I think we should move away.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.960
But...

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.110
Let's save moving
as the last resort.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.470
At that time,

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.420
l thought l should stay
and stop the game,

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.860
but in the end, many people died,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.380
and l couldn't protect
Mr Hosokawa and Mr Kono.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.620
So...

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.500
l...

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.140
What do you want to do?

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.160
I only want to protect you.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.590
Okay.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.150
Maybe it seems like l'm running away
and it's irresponsible...

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.390
That's not true.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.710
I also hope that nobody
will be harmed,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.810
but if l can only protect
one person, l'll protect you.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.150
And the other reason that l think
we should move away

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.750
is the piece of paper Miss Kinoshita
showed me the other day.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.240
I think you'll be killed.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.920
What? Someone wants to kill
both of us?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.190
No, this...

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.920
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.200
You got the wrong idea.
l wasn't sure at that time,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.480
but it probably was...

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.110
l saw it on the news.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.200
His funeral...

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.280
Okay, then. Bye.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.870
It really was Mr Kono?

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.790
Wait!

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.190
I wrote the name of my subordinate,
his name is Takafumi Kono.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.560
Evidence. l've got evidence!

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.750
Good evening.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.080
The trick is to push
the attacker's wrist to the side.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240
I see.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.720
Push his arm to one side and...

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.720
Mummy, amazing!

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.640
- Let's move on.
- Please give me a break!

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.320
It's okay if l'm murdered?

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.600
Of course not! But if someone
attacks you, just shout.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.840
If you're attacked,
go behind the attacker.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.200
Don't fight with him.
Call the police.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.960
And l think you should run--

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.040
Mummy, amazing!

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.400
Kuroshima?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.800
Sanae.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.400
Are you coming home from school?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.440
Yes, l took too many days off,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.840
so l had to go to school.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.600
Oh, or you won't be able
to graduate.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.600
If Miss Ono knows,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.240
she'll probably say that if l go
to school at a time like this,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.600
l must be the murderer.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.680
I just thought maybe
you were the murderer.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.680
I am on my way
to the convenient store, too,

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.240
"Having a late night snack
at a time like this?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.680
Are you the murderer?"

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.160
She'll probably say that.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.310
Lately, l've been thinking
that even smiling is inappropriate.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.870
I'm going to suffocate.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.680
Indeed.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.160
- See you.
- Do be careful.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.600
It was supposed to be

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.320
my turn to kill Mr Kono
if the game went in that order.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.780
But someone else killed him.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.900
I see.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.380
So l think it is not a murder-swap
anymore now.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.580
All right.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.700
I will investigate this myself, too.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.740
Excuse me. Would you talk
to other detectives about this, too?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.040
Regarding this, l think
l talked to you the other day.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.510
I concluded that investigating this
on my own

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.550
is the shortcut to solving the case.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.750
This meeting between you and me,

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.350
keep it a secret from Mr Enomoto.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.910
You did, but...

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.110
Excuse me.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.950
Why do you think
that investigating the part

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.470
about the murder-swap on your own
is the shortcut to solving this?

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.310
I am sorry, but l can't tell you
about my investigation.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.190
Did Sanae do something?

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.230
Who is Sanae?

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.630
The wife of Community Safety
Division's Mr Enomoto.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.790
You know that, right?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.670
I didn't know Mrs Enomoto's name.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.710
But she lives in the condo
of the case you're investigating.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.270
How can you not know?

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.750
It should be written in detail
in the data,

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.070
but l didn't memorise all of it.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.430
So, what did Mrs Enomoto do?

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.830
Well...

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.390
l am investigating a murder case.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.310
Don't poke your noses into it
out of curiosity.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:09.190
That's not why...

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.630
lf it ruins the investigation,
then l've done futile.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.380
I don't think you want that
to happen.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.850
Something isn't right with this.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.500
But keeping the murder-swap a secret
from other people

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.420
won't be beneficial to him.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.700
But he still investigates this
on his own,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.300
is it because he is covering it up
for Sanae?

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.380
Cover up?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.100
Like, the detectives
are on the same side

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.700
and they hide anything scandalous
for their friend.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.540
Then, Mr Kamiya doesn't have
to do this on his own, does he?

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.140
Or on the contrary,

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.140
to prevent the whole organisation
from hiding it,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.340
maybe he is investigating it
on his own?

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.540
If that's case,
we shouldn't get in his way.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.900
But in either case...

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.820
ln either case, it still means
that Sanae killed someone.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.220
Gosh, l really hate this.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.100
I hope what we deduced was wrong.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.580
I see.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.620
"Car disused"

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.970
Nothing.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.260
Thanks.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.220
Hello, l'm Kamiya. Yes.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.290
It's about that.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.060
Yes.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.980
Yes.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.100
Hello!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.660
Somebody complained about you
quite a long time ago,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.260
but you didn't hear it
because there was no caretaker,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.220
so l'll tell you now.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.500
It's too late now,
but it was from Akaike.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.460
Right. He doesn't speak.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:17.820
Will you hurry up?

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.460
You have a great voice
when you speak.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.420
"An offensive odour
comes from Room 501,

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.460
there is noise like a bird
being strangled,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.900
and noise like someone purring,
and it's noisy."

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.140
What the heck?
Did you bring a woman home?

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.140
I'm jealous. You have the looks
that let you stay silent.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.460
"Takafumi Kono's Funeral"

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.340
Please accept
my deepest condolences.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.940
Thank you.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.820
"Reception"

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.220
Mr Tamiya.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.730
Actually...

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.130
l should leave?

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.290
Well, l don't mind,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.150
but some people suspect you.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.330
Are you saying that l killed Kono?

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.450
Nobody says that so directly.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.470
I worried about Kono so much
that l even warned him!

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.810
That's exactly why.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.250
What?

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.770
I give up.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.850
- Mr Tamiya again?
- Exactly.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.220
Calling me was bad enough,
he finally came here himself.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.500
He went, "Danger is really
approaching, do be careful!"

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.660
lt was horrible.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.060
I gave up and just listened,
then he started to lecture me.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.740
I told him,
"Your calibre is low as a person,

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.210
so you don't have enough wisdom
to listen to my advice."

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.590
So it seems.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.810
But why does it make me
the murderer?

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.720
It has been bothering him
after all...

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.920
So this...

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.170
Oh, Kono, your name tag.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.130
He has been telling everybody

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.060
that the killer you hired
was after him, so he hid his name.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.690
Excuse me...

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.580
"Condolence Money: Junichiro Tamiya"

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.330
Excuse me!

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.330
I am innocent!

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.390
Just until we find our next flat.

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.820
What? Don't do that!

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.890
Everyone still thinks
that the murder-swap is going on.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.830
Just by showing them
that we're looking for the murderer

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.300
can be a deterrence.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.310
But we don't know
what Mr Kono's murderer is thinking

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.300
That person could think
you are a nuisance...

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.460
and come after you.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.620
That's convenient. l'll be the bait
and lure the murderer out.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.020
But it's risky!

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.550
I'll be all right. Nana, make sure
that you lock the door chain. Yeah?

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.010
Has there been any change?

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.170
Well, nothing happened so far.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.690
Do you know anything about
the Yoshimura on the piece of paper?

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.290
How do l know?

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.410
Many people's surname is Yoshimura.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.690
Yes, indeed.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.930
I guess,

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.460
the only clue is the person didn't
use any honorific before Yoshimura?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.100
The person must've been reluctant
to participate

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.660
if they didn't try to let you know
the name.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.460
So if in the future--

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.700
What's the matter?

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.500
I am sorry!

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.580
I just wanted to see the result
of my training.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.380
For my children, too,
l can't afford to get killed.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.380
No need to worry about me.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.420
The threats have stopped.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.700
I see.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.980
You did fulfil your duty.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.260
What are you implying?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.740
We know clearly the name you wrote
and the name you drew,

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.620
what l want to know is
if you threatened anyone,

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.300
like you were threatened yourself.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.980
I apologise about the knife.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.940
"Your turn to kill"

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.820
l didn't.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.740
Will you...

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.460
What?

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.740
Tell your lies more skilfully?

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.100
What?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.340
You try to distract me
by shouting at me.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.500
Has it ever gone well?

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.540
What's your point?

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.540
If your threat was successful,
then it's the police's job,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.370
and l won't say anything.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.310
But if you're still threatening
someone, please stop.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.850
That's all.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.850
I think Xinyi wrote "Masao Tanaka,"

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.970
l'm not wrong, am l?

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.650
But l don't know what name you got.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.450
If it's in that order,
l think it should be Mrs Akaike.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.690
Xinyi doesn't know Japanese.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.810
But we talked at the diner.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.010
Right? You said,
"Would you please wait?" to me.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.730
It was in your dream.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.130
How can it be a dream?

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.610
In Vietnam,

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.930
we call this "beating the tiger's
back with watercress."

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.850
l don't get what you mean at all.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.290
Please leave.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.570
But she...

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.650
Just leave.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.970
- I...
- Leave.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.450
- Was it okay?
- Yeah.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.970
I only talked to them.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.730
But Miss Ono wasn't home.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.650
She's the one l want to talk to
the most.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:14.760
Miss Ono!

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.890
Oh, you can't.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.690
If you have that massage too often,
it will make you tired instead.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.010
So l won't give you one today.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.530
No, it isn't about that.
lt's about the paper.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.810
You wouldn't tell me no matter what
when l asked you the other day.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.770
Because l was terrified.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.450
If l say something l shouldn't,

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.570
maybe someone will kill me.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.850
I know,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.210
but we'll find out many things
at once if you tell us.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:50.710
Then...

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.380
Please hug me.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.740
Pardon?

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.740
If l feel safe,
maybe l can tell you.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:03.650
So l--

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.180
All right, now...

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.210
Miss Ono.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.650
Will you tell us now?

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.180
The look on her face is terrifying.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.700
No, it's not.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.170
Would you tell us, please?

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:31.810
I'm scared.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.460
No.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.380
I can't tell you.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.050
Sorry.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.130
What? You--

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.190
The girl is funny, huh?

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.630
Nana, are you angry?

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.690
No.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.850
I just thought that Miss Ono
always locks her door chain.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.860
But after so many murders,
she must be careful.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.780
But it was since the first time
we met.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.580
I am Ono.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.220
But she's a lady and she is living
alone, maybe it's normal.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.780
But, indeed, l've just been
to many people's flats,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.980
you can see the visitor
on the monitor,

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.620
so everybody unlocked the door chain
when they opened the door.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.620
Has Orangutan Time begun?

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.500
Someone else
always locks the door chain, too.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.060
Who?

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.380
Sanae.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.380
Could there be something that she
doesn't want other people to see?

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.300
You can't run away
by saying nothing.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.540
You attacked this man, didn't you?

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.790
There is a witness, too.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.510
"She beat him with a baseball bat
37 times."

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.670
The witness should've helped the man
instead of counting.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.510
Your boyfriend told us everything.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.350
Your lie is so obvious.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.030
He looks weak, but he has some guts.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.870
How would he talk?

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.230
I tried to get him to tell me
who killed Mr Ukita.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.230
But he didn't know anything
because he didn't kill Ukita.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:49.870
No, l'm sorry.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.350
Is this the same baseball bat
you used to kill Yoshihiko Hakamada?

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.830
No, you got it wrong.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.070
We went to steal oranges
from an orchard that night,

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.270
so we couldn't tell you.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.710
What about the night
that Mr and Mrs Akaike was killed?

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.950
That night...

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.430
We beat up the wrong person.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.390
What are you talking about?

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:15.790
Airi wanted to kill her father
who abandoned her and her mother,

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.230
so we went to Yamanashi
to beat him up.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.350
But we realised
that we got the wrong guy.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:23.470
What?

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.750
Then, we found out that this guy
is her father.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.910
So we asked Mr Ukita to come with us

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.590
to arrange the hospital
and help to hush him up.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.790
I can't let them ask me
what l did that night.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.110
That happened on the night
that the Akaike couple were killed.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.550
So Airi did not kill anyone.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.790
Please believe me.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.910
No disturbing case happened
after that.</i>

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.310
When we have found the place
we'll move to,</i>

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.990
our neighbours have returned
to our residents' meeting.</i>

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.710
What?

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:06.350
So they have also heard
about the game.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.910
I can't believe it, though.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.350
And it's okay. lt started by chance.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.750
A number of people died, like, their
deaths were related to the game,

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.270
and we were shocked. Right?

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.950
It's a coincidence
that we don't want.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.660
Well, whatever caused their deaths,
they actually died,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.140
so l'd like to talk about
the security.

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.740
You mean...

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.820
My company has developed an app...

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.380
The neighbours
are surprisingly calm.</i>

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.060
Especially to the people
who don't know Takafumi Kono's death</i>

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.220
and the fact that Mr Kuzumi
wrote Yoshihiko Hakamada's name,</i>

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.340
the last murder stopped
at Mr Ukita's.</i>

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.900
Even regarding that...</i>

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.860
At the end of the day,
the guy was a gangster.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.220
Maybe he had trouble with someone.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.180
I thought the game was the cause.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.830
If you mention that,
Mr Kuzumi's accident, too...

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.660
lt can't be just a coincidence
if he died.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.300
I heard that the man with him
passed away.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.780
You know a lot.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.020
Read some newspaper.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.260
And then,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.300
the Kojima couple and the Akaike
couple were on bad terms,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.500
so the couples killed each other.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.620
What about the last caretaker?

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.900
He committed suicide to begin with.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.300
Oh, if that's the case, actually,

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.140
the game has nothing to do
with anything that happened.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.980
Oh, that's true!

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.980
If you play such a negative game,

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.420
you'll be pulled
by a negative magnetic field.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.380
It makes you think about everything
that happens to you in a bad way.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.660
This often happens.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:57.700
Yes, that's right.
The magnetic field was bad.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.100
- So, chairlady.
- Yes?

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.420
I would like to declare
that the game is over now.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:04.460
All right?

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.740
Well...

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.150
What does everyone think?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.130
You are all here?

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:27.030
I found something left by the last
caretaker that says "apology gift."

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.990
- Apology?
- Yes.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.630
Who is it for?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.340
"To Nishimura"

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.260
ls Nishimura here?

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:46.980
Yes.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.900
The apology gift is for you.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.500
Thanks.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.580
Wait.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.620
It's over, right?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.260
Excuse me.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.220
Wait--

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.580
See you later.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.280
See you.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.540
- Mrs Tezuka.
- Yes?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.760
Please go without me.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.280
Is it all right to declare
that the game is over?

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.080
As l had seen this piece of paper,
l couldn't just sit and do nothing.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.520
Thank you.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.880
I want to help you,

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.560
so will you tell me
what you're hiding?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.320
Pardon?

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.820
There's something
that you didn't tell us, right?

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.100
Why do you think so?

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.060
If you ask me back why l think so,

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.670
that means you really have a secret.
That's why l asked.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.430
I didn't participate in the game,

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.790
so there's no conflict of interest.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.150
Can you trust me?

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:07.470
But l have no secret.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.550
Can we exchange secrets, then?

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:15.230
I have some very important
information about this game.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.820
It's about the chairlady.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:20.980
Sanae?

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.420
Do you want to know?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.510
You do, don't you?

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.260
If you tell me yours first.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.330
I am sorry,
but l can't trust you yet.

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:38.170
But this is to protect myself,

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.850
so l will make a deal with you
without trusting you.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.080
If the information is trivial,

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.600
l will only say something
that is as trivial, too.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.500
As the person
responsible for cleaning,

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.040
when l checked how the rubbish
was sorted,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.440
l found this by chance.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.510
"Chairlady, no money is deposited.
Why? l'll show them the photo!"

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.520
I found this in the caretaker's
rubbish bag.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.080
I found two similar notes,
maybe he wrote them wrong.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.060
Maybe there's some kind of trouble

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.940
between the caretaker
and the chairlady.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.260
"Chairlady, no money is deposited.
Why? l'll show them the photo!"

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.780
Okay.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.060
Now, it is your turn.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.920
Please tell me what you are hiding.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.880
The piece of paper.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.980
The one with "Room 302" written.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.050
It was used when we voted to decide
who'd be in charge of cleaning.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.850
What?

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.090
I remembered.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.010
The caretaker read it out.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.290
"Room 302's lady, one vote,"
he said.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.650
This piece of paper has nothing
to do with the murder-swap.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.410
That was nasty.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.690
You are the nasty one.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:53.770
Why?

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:57.290
You showed me the piece of paper
to make me scared

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.370
and you tried to get information
out of me.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.370
You started to be in charge
of cleaning

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.490
since the day after the caretaker
passed away,

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:09.570
so when did you open
his rubbish bag?

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.130
Have you been opening
the neighbours' rubbish bags

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.610
before you became in charge
of cleaning?

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.890
I won't tell anyone.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.570
See you.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:34.010
That's all for today.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.370
"Chiunque Kuramae"

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.700
Orangutan Time.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.000
At that time,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.480
Sanae called us.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.800
It took us several minutes
to arrive.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.880
The window was open,

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.240
but this is the 5th floor.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:35.080
The murderer tried to avoid
people's eyes when they ran away,

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.480
so they chose the stairs
instead of the lift.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.800
If the murderer was a resident,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400
they would run back to their flat,

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.080
but if they ran away
from the condo,

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.120
this should be about
how empty the street was.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.420
If they run towards that direction,

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.970
they have to go past
the convenience store.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.130
When they were running away,

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.250
they got worried

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:13.770
and stopped.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.130
They looked back.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:26.960
"Club Carpark"

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
They smoked a cigarette
when they were running away.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.000
Of course not.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.360
In that case...

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.320
That's right.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.400
Changing their outfit

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.810
to cause confusion
in eyewitness information

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.970
is the usual method.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.410
That means...

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:06.370
The toilet?

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.450
Sanae's husband-- Wait!

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.650
Hey, what are you doing?

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.690
Sanae's husband, you--

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:20.080
What?

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.680
What?

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.240
- What...
- Well...

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.480
You're right where l want you.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.280
I got drunk.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.240
But you've been fighting, right?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.120
Kamiya, sorry for making you
walk me home.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.040
I can go home myself now.

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.920
- I haven't finished--
- Now!

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.240
He will walk me home.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.410
Yes?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:43.730
Please.

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.690
All right.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.440
Sorry, but please walk him home.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.840
Sure.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.440
I'll contact you again.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.400
What?

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.010
- Wait.
- The acid is coming up.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.170
- Are you okay?
- l'm sorry.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.720
Don't worry about it.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.580
I don't smell alcohol on you at all.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.100
Gosh.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.680
- Sorry about this.
- lt's okay.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.290
Why do you investigate alone?

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:27.570
I can't tell you.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.610
He didn't tell Sanae's husband?

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.010
Mr Enomoto didn't participate
in the game,

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.200
- if he did something...
- lt was for Sanae.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.740
Did Sanae do something?

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.740
Who is Sanae?

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.420
Maybe he investigates it on his own
to prevent

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.300
the whole organisation
from hiding it.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:56.500
I can go home myself now.
Thank you.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.020
- Thanks.
- lt's okay.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.380
Well then, good night.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.500
Good night.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.180
Maybe there's something she doesn't
want other people to see?

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.980
Oh, good evening!

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.180
Hey!

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.740
What...

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.940
What the heck?

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.220
Well, your steps weren't steady,
so l got worried.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.380
The way you worry is rude.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.320
I'm sorry.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.280
What's the point of apologising
to me?

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.960
Well, l did apologise to Sanae
and her husband.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.840
Why did you peek into their flat?

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.640
I just thought that
they were hiding something.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.880
Even so, they can't possibly put it
in the centre of their flat.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.480
You never know.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.920
If you put a corpse in a suitcase,
it's quite obvious, right?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.640
Whose dead body?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Mrs Kojima?

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.330
Don't say something so scary!

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.810
Anyway, don't do anything
you shouldn't.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.370
But l do this for you.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.570
If this is for me,
then you should stop.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.490
But...

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.610
lf anything happens to you,

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.050
if you are killed because of me,

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.570
how am l going to live?

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.250
I don't know!

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:35.960
That jerk.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.520
Do you think he realised?

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.560
I'm sorry.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.560
I have to do something
about that guy.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.600
Calm down, l won't die.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.520
Because l love you.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.640
How can l die and leave the person
l love so much behind?

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.440
But love can't solve everything.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.240
- It can.
- lt can't.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.920
I love you very much, too.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.890
I love you so much,

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:16.880
but l can't solve the problem
with both my ex and the game.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.800
I am so, so sorry.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.010
It's all because
l don't love you enough.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:22.930
Impossible.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.890
I'll feel hurt
if there's another reason.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:27.810
How can it be your fault?
lt's all my--

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.630
l want you to blame me
for everything.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.430
But you already love me so much,
it's like l'm asking for more.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.150
I want you to ask me
to love you even more.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.910
How can l say that
after you kiss me?

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.320
You don't have to
because l understand.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.320
So good! lt's delicious!

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.600
The fried chicken with tartar sauce
is so good!

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.560
- How many times will you say that?
- l haven't said enough!

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.520
So good!

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.600
I heard that people say nothing
if it is really delicious.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.990
You scare me. Say something.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.640
But you just told me to say nothing.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.080
I was joking.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:24.080
To check whether it's the chicken
or the sauce that is delicious,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.640
make fried pork with tartar sauce
next time.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.960
Sure. What about fried beef
and tartar sauce?

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.240
That too.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.240
So good!

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.240
It's so good!

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.320
So good!

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.280
Thank you for the supper!

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.200
Thanks.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.600
- Okay, next.
- Next?

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.000
The next urge
after the one for food.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.120
Oh, let me have a break first.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.080
No.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.680
- Oops.
- But l'm tired!

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:57.920
- Don't run away!
- No!

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.720
Come on!

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.880
Oh, man!

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.880
Come on, Nana!

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Open the door.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.600
Give up and let me make love to you.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.400
Nana.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.250
I hit the bull's eye.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.470
Nothing. Why?

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:34.550
I decided to give up.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.610
Hey! Dive!

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:40.410
- Boom!
- You're heavy!

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.520
See you later.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.570
Take care.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:49.810
You too, Nana.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.570
- Bye.
- Once more.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.240
- See you.
- See you.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.360
I am really sorry.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.760
Excuse me?

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.400
Shota? What's the matter?

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320
Shota!

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.480
Shota!

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.280
Please open the door!

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.130
All the flats' layout
should be the same.

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.730
Shota! Open the door!

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.520
Kuroshima?

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.490
Shota...

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.330
Wait a second.

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.650
Thank you for your message,
l'm so happy!</i>

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.440
Just wait a second.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.520
Wait, Sanae!

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.200
No!

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.150
Oh, shit.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.300
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.580
"Preview"

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.740
"Chapter One, last episode"

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.820
lmprisoned.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:54.980
I'll help you.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:55.980
Run away with me.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.260
What's in the box?

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.580
"What is in the box?"

00:45:58.700 --> 00:45:59.540
Sanae!

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.460
"Who will be killed?"

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.660
l'll kill Shota and myself!

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.890
Shota!
