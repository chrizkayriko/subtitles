00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.050
We wrote the names
of the people we want to kill</i>

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.810
and showed each other secretly.</i>

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.530

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.460
I wrote Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.120
The name l wrote on the piece
of paper was Mrs. Kayo Kojima.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.560
We should tell the police.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.660
I won't be arrested, will l?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.960
Make sure
you don't tell other detectives.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.690
I won't kill just because
l got a threatening note.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.050
Who did this?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.370
I'm suspecting someone.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.690
I'll try to get an answer myself.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.890
People are cornered, but still...</i>

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.290
Ukita?

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.050
And the man whose name l wrote...</i>

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.890
l've been doing lift maintenance
for 20 years!

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.210
l guess this is it.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.610
I will die.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.410

Darn...

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.980
l don't want to die
when she still hates me.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.220
Ouch...

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.020
Sorry, Jessie.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.500
It isn't your fault.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.160
- Yes?
- Sorry for coming so early.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.760
Please come to the police station
with us.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.840
He's dead.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.240
What?

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.600
He...

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.590
He died.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.070
What?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.070
Don't worry about me...

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.990
it's okay to cry...

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.030
Hey, bring her with us now.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.090
But that's her husband...

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.710
The woman could've killed him.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.430
Sorry, but it's time to go.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.430
Okay.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.430
- Nana...
- l'll be okay.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.990
A horrible wife
who requested someone

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.990
to kill the husband she divorced.

They are cursed.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.800
All right, where should we begin?

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.800
Maybe from whether we should
investigate it with Kuzumi's case?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.510
Is his job related
to the crime scene in any way?

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.350
Sir, Kuzumi works
at a lift maintenance company,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.630
he was responsible for the
maintenance of the lift there.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.790
He could tamper with it
if he wanted to?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.590
The security camera was broken,
so we don't know the details.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.310
However, Kuzumi's toolbox
was left at the crime scene.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.160
By the way,
Kuzumi's subordinate said

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.560
that he was pretty obsessed
with lifts.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.520
Obsessed with lifts!

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.720
He regularly fiddles with the lift
in the condo he lives in for fun.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.680
Dear me...

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.240
He'd make the lift silent
when it arrives

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.800
and says that
"Angelina became modest."

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.200
What? He names the lifts?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.680
I guess he didn't have any friends.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.070
For now, we can't verify whether
it was intentional or an accident.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.430
In that case,
we have to start with her.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.510
"Suspect, Nana Tezuka"

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.910
ls Mr. Hosokawa her brother
or her husband?

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.910
He's still married
with Nana, legally.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.710
I called him Big Bro
without knowing that.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.630
Someone wrote on a forum
to ask for someone to kill Big Bro,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.830
so the police suspects
that Nana wrote it.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.510
And Nana is still in custody today?

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.000
Someone murdered another person
and put Nana through this.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.800
You borrowed someone's smartphone,
wrote you want a murder-swap,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.760
and put Mr. Hosokawa's photo
on the forum.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.080
I told you, l--

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.080
A week after the first message
was written,

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.000
Mr. Hosokawa himself
called the police,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.560
and without a doubt,
you are the murderer.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.800
However, that evening,

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.920
Mr. Hosokawa was involved in a fall
with your friend, Yuzuru Kuzumi,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.920
and died there.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.360
I did not write that message.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.480
Did Yuzuru Kuzumi read this message?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.160
I don't know.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.600
I already told you yesterday.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.560
You've been separated for years

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.960
but he didn't agree
to get a divorce,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.320
so you wanted to murder him...

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.800
l've answered this question
many times as well!

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.270
We were taught to ask
the same questions again and again.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.430
Why is that?

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.160
Tell her why.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.840
Because if you are lying,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.240
we'll gradually see a hole in it
if we ask over and over again.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.560
Is that the reason?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.150
And? Have you found any hole
in what l've told you?

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.070
We haven't.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.830
- Then...
- Come on!

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.190
Do you know how many people
who lived in your condo died?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.230
Let us investigate it thoroughly.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.910
But it's the game...

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.590
That's how tricky the case is,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.070
make sure you don't tell
another detective.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.590
I'm here because l want to help.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.310
I did nothing suspicious...

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.710
Sir!

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.790
You scared me!
l died for two seconds!

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.190
- Sorry, sir, but...
- What is it?

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.730
Is there any connection
between Mr. Kuzumi's accident

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.750
and Mr. Ukita's death?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.130
By the way, who among these
three people wrote Mr. Ukita's name?

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.330
Three people?

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.530
Well...

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.050
lf Mr. Ukita was killed...

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.730
that means among Mr. Tamiya,
Miss Ono and the caretaker,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.330
one of them
wrote Mr. Ukita's name, right?

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.580
Yes, you're right.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.140
Who do you think it is?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.700
"301, Ono"

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.140
"Caretaker, Tokoshima"

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.500
Mr. Tokoshima?

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.340
Why?

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.540
Among the three,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.660
Mr. Tokoshima wasn't really
on good terms with Mr. Ukita.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.340
- I see.
- No matter who wrote it,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.580
the people who could've drawn
Mr. Ukita's piece of paper were...

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.710
Mr. Tamiya, Xinyi, Miss Ono,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.010
Mrs. Akaike and the caretaker.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.590
There are five people.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.550
But Mrs. Akaike and the caretaker
are dead,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.760
so the people who could've killed
Mr. Ukita are...

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.760
Mr. Tamiya...

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.960
Xinyi...

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.130
and Miss Ono.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:45.850
l...

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.090
Miss Ono.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.090
Sorry for saying something
l shouldn't the other day.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.850
When someone dumps me like this,

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.250
l'm scary.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.610
It isn't enough as an apology,

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.530
but this is a massage oil
made with natural ingredients.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.700
It's good for your skin
and it makes you calm too.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.820
Oh, but you see...

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.180
l won't give you this.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.540
If l give it to you,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.580
you will turn a cold shoulder
to me again.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.020
No, Miss Ono--

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.500
So l'll apply it on you now.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.020
What? Why?

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.500
No, thank you!

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.170
- Don't bother...
- Don't move.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.070
Wait...

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.130
What?

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.210
He gave it to you?

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.130
The caretaker made it himself.</i>

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.330
Were you and Mr. Tokoshima
close friends?

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.970
We hadn't really spoken.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.450
What about Mr. Ukita?

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.610
Why do you ask?

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.170
Well, because...

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:08.350
You suspect everything
when you're tired.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.550
No, that's not what l mean.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.590
Pressing on the acupressure points
makes your body and mind relax.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.310
- Hey, are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.790
We found the owner of the smartphone
used to write the forum's request,

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.670
a man spoke to her
when she was jogging...

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.670
He cried and said it was urgent,
so l lent it to him.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.170
The characteristics of the man...

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.350
He looked exactly like the man...

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.750
You see,
the man who just passed away...

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.890
Oh, Yoshihiko Hakamada!

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.010
- What?
- The description of his outfit

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.890
also matched Kuzumi's clothes.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.690
So Kuzumi borrowed a phone

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.610
and wrote the request to kill
Mr. Hosokawa on the forum?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.930
Why?

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.420
We don't know his motive.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.700
I guess it's quicker
to wait for Kuzumi to wake up.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:24.500
"Sumida Police Station"

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.820
Excuse me.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.130
I guess you've already realised.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.020
I did not tell anyone
about the murder-swap.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.180
What?

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.580
You're investigating it alone?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.220
Yes. l...

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.530
lf you investigated properly,
Mr. Ukita...

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.290
and Mr. Hosokawa didn't have to die!

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.250
I'll talk to other detectives.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.290
Wait a minute.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.890
Wait a minute!

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.170
This is because...

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.130
there's a problem.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.570
- Problem?
- Yes.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.030
I hope didn't say anything
you shouldn't.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.430
Will you give me a break?
Were you tailing me?

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.150
I'm here just by chance.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.270
This coincidence might happen again.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.150
I didn't tell her anything.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.550
Then l won't say anything either.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.660
Ouch...

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:09.620
lt hurts...

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.780
How are you?

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.940
Have you gotten used
to life in hell?

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.100
Why did he go to hell?

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.740
He could've gone to heaven.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.900
Don't drink during the day.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.020
Heaven, huh?

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.820
He was nice to us,
but in other people's eyes,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.700
he was evil.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.900
That's true.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.820
What is this?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.620
Mr. Ukita loved it.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.580
I know, but bring him a fresh one.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.860
Idiot!

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.700
Mr. Ukita loved one that's soft

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.980
after being put in the fridge
overnight.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.980
Who killed him?

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.970
"Penguin Moving Company"

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.260
This is none of your business,
Mrs. lshizaki.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.020
It is my business.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.940
Why?

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.740
Because l want to run away too!

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.860
What?

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.740
Well...

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.190
Ms. Kitagawa is going to move away!
What do you say?

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.350
What can l?

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:02.230
She wants to run away alone!

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.110
We're all accomplices!

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.890
Excuse me, what should we do?

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.130
- Please carry this outside.
- Sure.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.530
You can't!

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.050
- You...
- Wait!

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.370
- Cut it out!
- l won't let you escape!

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.170
Hey! What are you doing?

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.550
It's your fault!

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.770
Who got the piece of paper
with my name on it?

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.370
What are you doing?

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.690
I'm going to be killed!

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.770
And it's her fault!

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.460
If you're so worried,
why don't you move away too?

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.700
Shut up!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.500
I bought my flat!

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.770
We have to pay the mortgage
for 20 more years!

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.050
Sell it, then!

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.770
How can l sell it?
lt's a murderers' condo!

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.370
- So this is the rumoured...
- What?

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.810
See? There's rumour going around
about it!

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.900
Sora.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.740
I think Sora fell from his scooter.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.780
What?

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.280
Are you okay?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.080
Sora?

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.360
Please wait for a moment.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.880
Sure...

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.440
l'm sorry.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.840
- Thank you.
- No worries.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.040
Sora, come.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.770
What happened?

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.480
It doesn't matter.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.720
When is this going to stop?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.840
As we told you the other day,
the detective, Mr. Kamiya--

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.960
ls that guy doing his job
properly?

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.760
He won't tell us
the results of the investigation,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.080
maybe the police will suddenly catch
the murderer tonight.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.920
Yes, maybe, but...

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.520
Anyway, let's calm down, okay?

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.680
I'm home.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.010
Thanks for having me.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.450
See you.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.190
Nana!

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.270
I'm home.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.310
I would've gone to pick you up
if you had told me.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.670
Sorry, l was tired.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.350
Then you should've called
all the more.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.650
What's the matter?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.840
I need the energy
to ask for help too.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.360
I was too tired
to ask for your help.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.360
Don't say that...

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.160
What have you been doing?

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.640
What did you do at Miss Ono's flat?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.040
Sorry... l was asking what name
Miss Ono wrote and drew...

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.400
Sorry,
please don't talk about that now.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480
I'll go and lie down.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.830
Sorry, l have to go alone.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.650
Don't worry about it, his relatives
will probably be present.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080
Are you okay?

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.480
Your eyes are swollen.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.670
See you later.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.470
If this is for Nana,

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.070
l'll do anything.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.880
It's none of your business!

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.160
But it's what you saved

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.320
for your retirement...

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.120
Hello. l would like to talk
about the name you wrote and drew.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.040
Go back inside.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.160
- I haven't finished--
- l said, go back inside!

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.640
Are you doing what you did before?

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.400
When will you stop nagging me
about my last job?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.040
You're the one who...

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.800
Drama is just a hobby, okay?
lt isn't your job--

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.880
- Sorry about that.
- lt's okay.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.840
How can l help you?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.400
- The name you wrote--
- l don't want to say it.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.400
Why?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.480
Because l've just found
my life's purpose, that is, drama.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.080
I don't want anything else
to take up my time. See you.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.720
Please don't go yet!

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.470
Please tell me.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.670
Knowing all the names is the answer
to solving the problem.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.840
Don't you think?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.910
I think it will let you concentrate
on your life's purpose too.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.750
I don't get
why you assume this pose.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.440
This pose is tougher than kneeling,

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.320
and it shows how serious l am.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.600
Please help me!

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.000
People will laugh at you.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.200
Please.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.600
Do be careful.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.960
You're just like who l used to be.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.000
What?

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.480
You have more passion than other
people, but you go in the wrong way.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.560
You'll only
bring other people trouble.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.680
It's fine if you only cause trouble,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.240
but they'll ridicule you
as a workaholic,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.800
spread rumours about you,

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.120
and eventually, you'll be cornered
and have to retire early...

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.100
l digressed.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.700
Could you have written the name
of a former colleague?

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.460
Please tell me!

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.220
It was my subordinate.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.820
I wrote the name of a man
called Takafumi Kono.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.500
On the paper l drew,

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.500
the name written was Takafumi Kono,
in Hiragana.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.340
I taught him
with all the experience l had.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.820
I was proud of this subordinate.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.220
Thank you for telling me.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.180
Also, on the piece of paper l drew,

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.500
it says, "Someone who can't
sort rubbish properly."

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.820
Thank you.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.980
I won't laugh at you.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.100
Good luck with your search
for the murderer.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.060
"Manager's office"

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.220
Excuse me.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.860
Room 304's Ms. Kitagawa...

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.260
They moved away yesterday.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.660
I see.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.830
Do you know where they moved to?

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.300
I didn't ask.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.140
Of course.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.420
But l can tell you
where she works.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.220
There you go.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.380
It's a secret.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.500
I'll now reply to messages from our
listeners. lt's Sumika Kitagawa's...

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.020
Oh, it's Grooving Jam
hosted by Ms. Kitagawa, right?

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.700
How do you know
such a local radio station?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.740
Why do you know, then?

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.020
I looked up data of everyone here.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.060
Ms. Kinoshita, you use
your real name at work too, right?

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.620
No, that isn't me.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.260
- Oh, and...
- Yes?

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.180
You didn't wipe the earphone
before you put it in your ear.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.660
It makes me fall in love with you.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.100
The matter has gotten too serious.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.380
We should keep a low profile.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.580
I'll apologise for the knife.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.060
"It is your turn to kill"

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.780
l'll also forgive you for hacking
into my computer at the hospital.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.860
What are you talking about?

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.500
India is an lT superpower now,
isn't it?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.940
I am Bangladeshi.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.140
The one who is familiar with lT
is the illegal immigrant here?

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.060
You really made all the threats?

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.580
What? You want to punch me?
Do it, then.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.020
Don't actually punch me!
l'll call the police!

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.260
You punched in a way
different from Japanese.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.460
Both of us will be in trouble
with the police.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.900
In that case...

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.620
tell me who it was.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.140
What?

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.930
Was it Mr. and Mrs. Akaike?
Or was it Yoshihiko Hakamada?

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.780
Who was it?

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.900
Tell me.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.560
What was revealed about this case?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.840
The murder was committed
by several people.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.960
It must've come to a dead end.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.400
Yutaro Yamagiwa's head
still hasn't been found.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.800
I'm not in charge,
but my stomach hurts.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.760
Reports about two cases
caused a stir,

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.880
that's why nobody pays attention
to ours and it helps a lot.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.920
If someone is arrested...

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.920
people will pay attention to it.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.520
And they will come out at once.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.040
Prepare yourself. We can't afford
to arrest the wrong person.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.160
But we haven't made any progress
on the cases of Mr. and Mrs. Akaike

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.160
and Kayo Kojima,
who is only a leg now.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.520
We'll be in trouble at this rate.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.720
I got a report from the forensics
about Ukita's death.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800
What is it?

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.280
They found something interesting

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.200
about the footprint
left at the crime scene.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.640
Sorry for asking you
to gather on a holiday.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.360
I'm really sorry.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.200
It's okay, this is better
than being alone at home.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.680
Yes, it makes me feel safer.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.590
Something is bothering me.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:36.630
It's unusual for people to write
a name of someone they want to kill,

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.110
did you do it as a prank?

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.810
No. Only a few people
actually wanted to do it.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.090
Everyone else was reluctant.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.890
I probably stopped talking
halfway through.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.250
Someone might complain
if we didn't write a name,

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.230
there was an awful tension
in the air.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.190
I see.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.230
In the midst of it, isn't it weird
that a piece of paper was blank?

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:00.950
If someone did this,

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.950
someone might demand to know
who didn't write a name down.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.390
Why didn't Ms. Kitagawa say

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.470
that the piece of paper was blank
and someone cheated at that time?

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.350
Indeed.
Now l'm curious after you said this.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.710
Isn't this curious?

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.190
Yes, indeed.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.670
Usually, footprints aren't left
at a place like this.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:27.920
Maybe when the murderer strangled
Ukita with a piece of wire...

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.840
they stepped on it!

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.550
So this is the murderer's...

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.520
- How long is it?
- 26.5 centimetres.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.520
It's an average shoe size for men.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.560
If it's a woman, she is quite tall.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.440
But that alone won't tell us much.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.250
You want to say Ms. Kitagawa lied
just based on that?

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.970
Kuroshima said the other day

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.670
that it was possible
that some people among us lied.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.070
Yes, but l didn't mean Ms. Kitagawa.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.390
She could've prepared
the blank paper afterwards,

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.510
it also prevented her
from digging her own grave

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.110
by saying a false name
and being asked in detail.

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.710
But it's just a thought, right?

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:11.030
Well, some people didn't give
a specific name as well,

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:15.760
and l suspect all of them.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.080
You mean...

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.560
"People who
don't give up their seat..."

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.480
"402, Enomoto"

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.880
And Oda Nobunaga as well.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.640
And "Someone who can't
sort rubbish properly."

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.840
l asked Mr. Tamiya.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.910
The name he wrote
was Takafumi Kono.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.070
- Is it...
- Yes.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.750
And on the piece of paper he drew,

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.810
it says, "Someone who can't
sort rubbish properly."

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.210
ln other words,

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:50.060
Ms. Kitagawa, Mr. Tamiya,

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.410
Kuroshima and l lied.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.250
Is that what you mean?

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.570
Yes, this is possible.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:58.570
Wait!

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.210
I'll talk about this
from a different angle.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.970
For now, people whom we don't know
what name they wrote are...

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.030
Miss Ono and the caretaker.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.070
The names that we don't know
were drawn by whom

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.830
were Mr. Ukita and the caretaker.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:18.830
In other words...

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.290
The names written by Miss Ono
and the caretaker

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.450
were either Mr. Ukita
or the caretaker.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.530
Correct.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.250
But l think it's unlikely
for the caretaker

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.250
to write his own name,

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.290
so Miss Ono wrote the caretaker

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.610
and the caretaker wrote Mr. Ukita.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.530
In that case,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.830
now we have filled
the "name written" column.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:52.000
Nobody wrote what was written on
the pieces of paper you two drew.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.280
What is going on?

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.280
Wait, you see...

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.200
Ms. Kitagawa and Mr. Tamiya too...

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.520
So l want to ask
the two of you first.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.800
I know you have alibis of when
murders happened in our condo,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.920
but in Mr. Ukita's case...

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.640
What did you do on that day?

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.000
Don't suddenly
treat us like suspects.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.240
I'm sorry.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.560
But when l was organising the facts,

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.360
l found that it is also
a possibility.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.200
It's just a possibility,

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.800
but Ukita could've been involved
in the gangsters' fight.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.810
But the gang that Ukita belonged to
didn't function as an organisation.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.350
I've checked people whom Ukita knew.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.070
He used to steal produce
from farms and orchards

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.590
and put them on black market,

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.950
then he'd gain the margin
of the sale.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:48.990
It was quite cheap as a thug's job.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.470
He hasn't been paying
his flat's rent either.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.010
What bothers me
is Mr. and Mrs. Akaike's murder.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.050
Why?

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.730
They didn't live in luxury,
but they were pretty rich.

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:02.800
Also, Ukita had no alibi on the
night the Akaike couple were killed.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.800
Ukita and the other two killed
Mr. and Mrs. Akaike for money,

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.120
they had a fight when dividing
the money and Ukita was killed?

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.000
If that's the case,
the people who killed Ukita...

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.120
were these two?

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.880
I think one of the four people here
killed Mr. Ukita.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.160
"Enomoto, Kuroshima,
Tamiya, Kitagawa"

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.420
This mostly hit the bull's eye.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.180
Wait, Shota.
What about Mrs. lshizaki?

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.540
The name, Yoshimura,
which Mrs. lshizaki said she drew,

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.940
wasn't written by anyone.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.180
But Mrs. lshizaki wrote her own name

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.460
and she's scared
that she'll be killed,

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.190
so l don't think she lied.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.500
That means...

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:52.740
Yes, somebody lied
about what name they wrote as well.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.540
If Mrs. lshizaki wrote her own name,

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.780
then the caretaker
could have written himself too.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.020
Who would use an honorific
when writing their own name?

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.100
It is a possibility.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:08.100
It's rude to suspect the ladies
when we aren't exactly sure.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.620
Well, l threw away
the piece of paper,

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.980
so l don't know how to prove
that l didn't lie.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.620
But the names written
by the caretaker and Mrs. Akaike

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.060
are only a deduction, right?

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.740
Exactly.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.260
Look, we don't know the names here
for sure too.

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.340
Yes, about Miss Ono.

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.660
I made a desperate effort to ask,
but she didn't tell me.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.900
See? There are too many holes
in the deduction, right?

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.340
Is that so?

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.460
I thought l hit the bull's eye...

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.620
l'm sorry/ l'll deduce this again.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.860
If everything will be solved
in the end,

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.620
l don't mind being suspected at all.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.700
Okay. l might suspect
the two of you again...

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.980
because l want to protect Nana.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.500
Okay.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.820
Frankly, l get overwhelmed easily,

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.660
and l think there will be times
that l can only see Nana,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.060
so l'm really sorry,
please forgive me.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.700
I'm so sorry!

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:31.670
Sanae and Kuroshima
must be secretly angry with me.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.550
Of course, l know you are too.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:36.470
I think they are angry

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.610
and l think they're hurt
because you suspected them.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.690
Sorry.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:43.250
However...

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:47.450
l don't know if l should speak
for Sanae too.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:48.650
Why?

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.210
I couldn't say it
because l was afraid to.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.130
The detective told me
something unusual.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.850
What? You couldn't say anything back
after he said that much?

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.730
What should l have said back?

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.130
It is true that l lied.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.490
Don't say you lied.
That wasn't a lie.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.650
No.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.690
What we also do, we do out of love!

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:19.050
If they find out
the various things about us...

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.630
it'll make our family seem
like we haven't got as much love

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.550
as that couple.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.470
It's frustrating!

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.710
But that's...

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:25.650
Am l wrong?

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:28.810
You are right!

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.950
It happened
when he was in middle school.</i>

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.710
So l said l'd go talk
to another detective...

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.230
- Problem?
- Yes.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.990
I can't tell you the details,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.930
but l found out a certain fact
about the game.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.930
However, l concluded
that investigating the case alone

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.210
is the shortcut
to solving the problem.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:53.170
What do you mean?

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.330
This meeting between you and me...

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.650
keep it a secret from Mr. Enomoto.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.850
He keeps it a secret
from Sanae's husband too?

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.730
But we talked to them together.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.090
He just repeated

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.710
that he couldn't tell me
more about the investigation.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.700
He found a clue,
but couldn't tell Mr. Enomoto...

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.580
That's what l've been thinking too.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.300
Mr. Enomoto was in the caretaker's
office at that time, right?

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.020
He didn't participate in the game.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.700
If he was doing something...

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.860
He did it for Sanae.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.070
I don't want to think that, but...

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.190
l think we should check out Sanae
as well.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.510
Hang on.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.750
I'm scared.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.150
Just let the police
take care of the rest.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.950
But we can't count on them!

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:47.110
Shota.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.030
Fine.

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.010
You promise?

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:02.070
Mr. Tamiya.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.250
Could it be here?

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.890
"TK Queen"

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.130
Very fine, isn't it?

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.270
Well...

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.950
But this place is closed, isn't it?

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.030
Of course!

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.830
I thought you were going to treat us
to lunch.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:27.630
I'll treat you to something,
but it isn't food.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:30.710
It's this lounge!

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:32.810
You mean...

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.350
We'll rent it
as our drama group's practise room.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.300
Look, although it's small,
there is a stage.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.860
We can even perform a short play.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.860
My seniors,
you are all pretty talented,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.540
if you have a place
where you can concentrate,

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:50.420
you can go a step further.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.630
Oh, this is difficult.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.850
We aren't a professional drama group

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.950
and we only do what we enjoy
when we aren't working, right?

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.550
You can aim to be pro now.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.610
The direction we go
should be a group decision.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.170
I'm running out of time!

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.490
What do you mean?

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:13.210
Anyway, l will pay
the whole sum of money.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:14.370
Are we happy with that?

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.050
I'm home!

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:30.210
Nana!

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.450
You're late! You should've called.
l was worried.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.890
Sorry. But l found the bank
where Mr. Tamiya worked!

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.410
Yes?

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.810
I tried to ask Mrs. Tamiya casually.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:43.090
You said we would
let the police do their job.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.170
But l meant Sanae's part.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.490
Let's go.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.090
No, l think we shouldn't.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.130
Why?

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.530
We should see
what Takafumi Kono is like.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.050
What will you do after that?

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:59.150
Tell him what's going on
and tell him to be careful.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.290
What can you tell him
about the situation?

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:02.210
I...

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.650
But l want to protect him.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.890
I don't want what happened
to Big Bro happen to him.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.810
Anyway, let's just meet him.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.210
Let's go.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:22.110
Thank you very much for talking
to us about getting a loan.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.670
Let's begin...

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.510
- Well...
- Please ask anything.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:31.870
Sorry for being rude, but would you
let Mr. Kono be in charge of this?

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.070
Mr. Kono?

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.390
Yes, Mr. Kono helped my friend
on getting a loan,

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.110
we heard that he was very helpful.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:47.750
I'm very sorry, but nobody
in our branch is called Kono.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.970
If he was transferred
to another branch,

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.620
and we have to check
all the bank's branches...

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.060
Orangutan Time.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.260
Pardon?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.330
There was something different
about the man just now.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.370
What is it? l give up. Tell me.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.650
He's the only one
who's not wearing a name tag.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.970
Please ask me anything.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.480
Oh, did he forget to?

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.440
Excuse me,
is Mr. Takafumi Kono here today?

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.760
- Kono?
- Yes.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.920
Let me see... Oh, he's over there.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.360
What's going on?

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.320
I don't know.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.040
Should l call him here?

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.560
No. Thanks a lot.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.040
That's too much!
l can't finish it within today!

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.320
- It's easy for you.
- Will you do it for me?

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.920
- Good luck.
- All right.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.200
Excuse me.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.960
Mr. Kono, l presume?

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.720
Wow... Seriously?
You're so annoying.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.800
Are you going to attack me here?
The security guard is over there.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.640
I think you've got the wrong idea.
We're Mr. Tamiya's...

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.760
That man told me.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.400
What is it? l will be killed?
Be careful when l go home at night?

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.240
He even gave me a book
on self-defence. lt's annoying.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.880
We won't attack you.
lt's the opposite.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.080
Yes, we want to see
that you're safe--

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.040
l don't care at all.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.280
I have nothing to do with that guy
in the first place.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.730
But Mr. Tamiya said you were
a subordinate he was proud of.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.290
I do the exact opposite
of what he does.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:45.030
He is too serious,
too honest, and too hard-working.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.950
What is wrong with that?

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.390
Despite that,
his performance was only average.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:52.810
It was too inefficient.

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:54.000
Inefficient?

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:57.430
Anyway,
don't drag me into your troubles.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.040
Mr. Tamiya said Kono
was a subordinate he was proud of,

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.880
but he wrote Kono's name.
l think l can understand why.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.880
Somehow it's frustrating.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.880
I won't laugh at you.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.200
Good luck with your search
for the murderer.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.680
But still, we should tell him
to be careful.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.160
I'll go and say it.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.320
Shota!

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.520
Sorry...

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.280
l'm sorry! Sorry.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.680
Wait, where is he?

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.800
Mr. Kono, please listen to me.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.360
Don't actually attack me.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:02.480
Pardon?

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.320
Mr. Kono!

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.760
- Mr. Kono!
- Are you okay?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.520
Call an ambulance.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.640
We should call the police.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.880
He must've done it.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.400
Hey, he did it, didn't he?

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.990
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.020
l would like to declare
that the game is over.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.940
Totally innocent!

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.460
There is something wrong.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:58.220
That means Sanae killed him.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:00.350
"What is Room 402's secret?"

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.390
l hope your suspicions are wrong.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.950
No!
