WEBVTT

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.460
An murder-swap game that was played without me realising it

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.450
Stop ~~‼

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.980
To conceal the crime
A runaway person appears...

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.450
Maybe Sanae's child.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.030
As soon as I realized that there might be some murders

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.070
Unrelated to the game...

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.030
Nana-chan

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.580
I'm full of revenge.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.940
Then, little by little...

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.420
It's trespassing!

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.440
I'm getting close to that someone,
The unknown murderer...

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.960
I can only hope...

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.950
Sora-kun, it's been a long time.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.950
Brother, Did you get out?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.520
I came to room 502. I'm Minami.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.940
- 502?
- Akaike-san's...?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.440
- That person.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.940
Gave me a good looking...

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.440
Birthday night?

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.600
♪ ~ Julia ~

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.290
Sano ~

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.520
Grandmother!
What are you doing?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.020
Grandmother! Can you hear!?
Grandma! Grandmother!

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.930
That person?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.940
Say someone gave her something.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.940
Huh?
So when I asked who that person was...

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.930
Ah... wasn't that person your dead wife?

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.460
Nana-chan?

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.850
Yes, the day when Mr. Akaike's incident occurred...

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640
Isn't it too flashy?

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.140
You look great

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.460
What does it mean…?

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.500
Kuzumi-san

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.540
Ah, Tezuka-san.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.940
I'm glad I was there.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.940
No, he's not ready to talk.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.440
I think it's hard just because I woke up.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.450
- No, it's not.
- Nice to meet you...

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.930
- Huh?
- That is...

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.470
- It's not memory loss...
- Nice to meet you.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510
My name is Yoshihiko Hamada.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.040
What?

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.430
He has regained consciousness
but he doesn't know himself

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.430
He thinks he is Yoshihiko Hamada.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.440
When he was 18 years old.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.270
- What about the incident?
- Seem like he doesn't remember.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.460
- Damn...
- Well, about him?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.500
You will have to monitor the progress.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.260
That's right...
Take a leisurely investigation.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.450
You're good at investigating.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.940
Well don't bully me ~.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.110
I have found out.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.910
The fingerprint on the paper labeled “Yoko Ishizaki”.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.920
- Whose was?
- Uhm about that...

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.990
Residents whose fingerprints were detected...

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.030
Great...

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.410
Yes?

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.260
Residents' association.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.920
Forcing me to talk to you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.470
What is the intention?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.520
Ms. Ono please tell me about the paper
you wrote and drawn.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.910
Search for the criminal who killed Nana.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.430
Yes, for Tezuka-san.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.060
- Isn't it good?
- With who?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.270
Oh Tezuka-san and me?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.520
Huh...

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
Thank you for this time.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.510
Would you like to go back together?

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.520
If you promise not to speak from the beginning.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.420
Let's go home now!

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.970
Ah!

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.540
No...

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.860
Huh...

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.280
Eh ~ Ono's

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.470
Organic grilled corn

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.470
is chosen.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.530
Then, the accountant and the cook

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.560
- And the caller...
- I...

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.930
I will refuse the same person as that person.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.420
Huh...
Then I will run as a poster clerk.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.440
Instead, no participation on the day.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.530
Ahh! I understand.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.930
- What are you doing?
- That person

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.930
While you are attending the festival

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.480
- He is trying to commit the next murder.
- Oh? next….

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.020
- What... what do you mean?
- Details now.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.420
- In other words, this person...
- Wait.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.560
- Wait!
- Please stop talking scary stories.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.950
Chairman has spoken!

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.270
By the way, only your wife legs has been found.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.940
- Where is the rest?
- The rest, you said...

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.960
Minami-san, such a story is...

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.480
- Good idea?
- Everyone is interested.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.910
So isn't it fun to talk about the festival?

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.420
Isn't it obvious?

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.920
There are times and places to worry about.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.420
That's right!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.440
Now it's best to calm down and think about the festival.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.930
It is certainly like a festival.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.270
The event to create an extraordinary space together.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.430
There is also an idea that the preparation time is bliss.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.940
- Everyone, get along well.
- Wow, your story

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.320
I won't come in!

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.420
It's a fresh reaction.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.590
We are already used to this.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.450
Hahaha... Huh...

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.010
Ah...
Well... I'm sorry.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.780
Then you entered Fujii's room no. 403.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.450
Wrap Yamagiwa head with a bath towel in the room

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.930
Left it in the washing machine and then recovered.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.940
- Are you sure?
- There is no mistake.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.970
But...

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.930
- You were in another place.
- No?

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.710
- Just before Mr. Fujii came home
- Please listen!

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.430
That matter has been confirmed.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.440
And then you immediately leave the room

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.940
You were shopping at a nearby convenience store.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.440
It has been confirmed with the security camera video

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.560
Wasn't your husband stealing the master key?

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.940
Several residents have witnessed your husband invading the manager's room.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.990
Was your husband who entered Fujii's room?

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.110
Yes I'm sorry.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.430
I lied to cover my husband.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.430
However, your husband

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.000
He was drinking at a girls bar with colleagues.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.560
Who are you really trying to cover?

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.470
Is that also?

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.540
I need your help in each shift.
Each time allocation is...

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.770
Can you tell me how to cook?

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.450
Just grilling?

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.980
But what is the organic part?

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.300
Ono-san, explain.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.120
- Ono-san?
- Eh?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.330
Explain what is different from ordinary corn.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:43.430
Ah... It doesn't use pesticides or chemical fertilizers.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.590
Recently, there are a lot of fertilizers used.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.970
You see, the absorption of cesium
Something to hold back.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.910
I don't understand what you said at all.
Ne everyone...

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.910
Oh, potassium chloride.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.420
The poison used for the killing is...

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.440
I understand that it was potassium chloride.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.410
Is Ono-san familiar with fertilizer?

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.910
Is there an obligation to answer personal questions?

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.910
Well, as a fertilizer you can get it online

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.920
It's safe, but potassium chloride itself

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.020
or animal euthanasia in the United States,
It is a drug used for execution.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.920
Right? Dr. Fujii.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.920
Huh? Yeah...

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.600
Minami-san, you are familiar.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.940
- Actually I….
- You

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.030
- What have you been doing since a while ago?
- Ahh….

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.410
I'm taking the minutes.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.910
What is it for?

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.410
It's my fault.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:01.430
I've been complaining that there are too many residents meeting

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.910
Make sure the meeting is organized in one session.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.640
Oh, yes.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.720
I'm sorry for causing you inconvenience.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.420
So today's resident association is finished.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.920
That!

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.410
This is a paper with the name of Ishizaki.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.930
- That!
- It was thrown away

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.950
Ms. Kinoshita discovered it.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.450
I want to know who drew it.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.420
Show me a bit...

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.000
Isn't it okay to answer honestly?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.260
Mrs. Ishizaki is safe.
There is no doubt.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.410
Well certainly.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.910
I asked the police to check for fingerprints.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:02.410
Fingerprints other than Mr. Kinoshita whose remained on this paper

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:06.750
Ms. Kitagawa, Mr. Kuzumi, Mr. Manager

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.930
Mr. Tamiya.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.270
Mr. Fujii.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.960
Ms. Ono.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.290
6 people.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.920
Did you get your hands on it when you drew the paper?
I just touched it at that time.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.430
I mean, Wasn't it Mr. Manager?

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.920
Well, there is a possibility.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.040
When was first time Ishizaki-san told everyone she wrote it herself?

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.930
At that time, no one came forward.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.960
The person who was already dead at that time must drew.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.520
Uhm...

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.920
Yes.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.610
Ah, okay, but nothing yet.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.020
- Yeah...
- All the residents are weird.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.430
You usually move, don't you?

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.950
- Then do you believe in Ono-san?
- Do you believe her?

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.010
- I thought there was nothing.
- Yeah.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.510
Paper that doesn't need to be hidden

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.410
After all, the previous manager drew it...

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.420
Damn! Not a clue...

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.420
Such...

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.770
It's progressing step by step.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.360
Sorry.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.080
If it's not the husband

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.510
There is only one person left.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.920
It's Soichi.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.630
So-chan was locked up in handcuffs.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.450
How did he get out? So that...

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.980
Wrong!

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.420
No different, different...
So-chan... Not so-chan!

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.920
Um... different!
Wrong!

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.440
Wrong! Different, different...!
No different...!

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.430
You are disqualified from investigation!

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.440
- Be replaced, Be replaced!
- Just calm down!

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.450
- This guy... Let this guy do it!
- Please calm down.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.950
Be replaced be replaced! Be replaced be replaced!
Instead...!

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.430
Soichi-kun.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.450
I just went to my room.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.920
I wanted to return this.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.450
Oh, I'll give you.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.440
It's originally a gift and I'm not good at letters.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.940
Well then.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.530
In terms of possibilities, the son will become the most suspicious.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.400
Maybe he was forced to do it

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.420
Did he do it on his own?

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.600
14 years old carrying pad thai….

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.120
Thank you.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.520
No….

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.090
Nana-chan was so happy.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.940
No matter how many times I hug her.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.080
I still want to hug her even more.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.580
It's great to meet such person

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.570
Fibonacci

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.090
The story is probably love.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.670
Let's go home

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.940
What's wrong?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.940
It's the current result,
but it's a little interesting.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.420
After all, Akaike couple, Ukita-san and Nana-san were killed

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.440
The possibility of the same person is high.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.510
And the relevance to the murder-swap game seems weak.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.480
But someonewho has the motive to kill all four...

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.480
I don't think so.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.480
The criminal has the taste of committing murder in search of pleasure.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.450
From that point, analyzing the data of the residents...

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.500
Huh?

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.030
I can't conclude that it's a certain murderer.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.950
This is a fairly high percentage.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.100
Wasshoi Wasshoi...

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.010
Wasshoi Wasshoi
Wasshoi Wasshoi...

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.010
It's true that Soichi is a little bit strange

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.420
Even now I still really wonder if he could escape from that room.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.820
What did he want me to do at that time?

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.470
I think a lot.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.410
However, the cat is dead

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.550
He wanted to bring it to the hospital.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.400
He is a very kind boy...

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.900
- This boy killed cat.
- Eh?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.920
The rate at which animals
are harmed before the killer commits an incident

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.920
is quite high.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.910
This feels good….

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.650
Uh... I can't understand.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:48.910
No...
I'm sure there are many strange things.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.430
In the first place, Soichi was on the veranda?

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.650
He was handcuffed when we were confined.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:03.420
And the absolutely off limit cooler box.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.910
I was curious. There was no lock or anything.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:09.410
But when Nana-san was killed

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.410
Wasn't Soichi in the facility?

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.290
That's... right.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.490
I understand that, but wait a little longer...

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.540
This time there is a guy who can catch the tail.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:30.900
Ah..

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.920
Huh...

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.520
- Ah... Ms. Sakuragi Stop...!
- All right!

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.910
No, no!
You're overdoing... Stop Stop.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.110
If you don't do too much...?

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.920
That...

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.580
Do you want to kill someone, Tezuka-san?

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.500
Huh?

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.460
I've been having too much laughing at work.
There was such a man as to feel murderous.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.430
If you don't let it go like this, you can't be serious.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.930
If this is enough for you,
then you'll have to go ahead.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.430
Are you going about another set?
Please listen.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.940
In the first place, my workplace...

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.780
- I don't think there's anything to say this morning.
- Eh?

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.940
- Ah... I'm a little busy now.
- In front of Shota-san

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.980
What about the overjoy of the criminal hunting?

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.430
- Did I look like that?
- I saw it.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.220
- Itadakimasu.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.910
Nikaido-san probably doesn't know but...

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:07.410
Shota-san was a much brighter person before.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.810
I want him to go back to the original Shota-san...

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.520
- What is it?
- No...

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.990
You're gonna eat so much...

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.910
Huh? Ahh….

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.400
If you have a problem,
your blood sugar level will go down.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.670
- Huh...
- Huhu...

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.830
- Don't look like that.
- Ah… I'm sorry.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.440
Kitagawa-san, excuse me?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.460
Ah detective.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.970
- In the case of the murder-swap game.
- Is it going to be solved?

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.450
No... Well...

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:04.640
- Oh, are you together?
- Yeah.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.160
I make my decision quickly

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.920
- That? That child...
- Just a little bit will do.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.460
- I want to cooperate.
- Thank you.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.540
I'll buy some drinks.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.980
You have had trouble with Kojima before

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.500
- So you just wrote her name.
- Yes.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.450
But until who drew my paper...

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.350
Eh, you can use the game

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.430
AND KILLED KOJIMA.
I can imagine it.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.440
What about the night of May 21?

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.960
Ahh….

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.970
Ah, I was broadcasting live at night.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.490
I was in the station before and after the broadcast time.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.910
- You can check it.
- I see

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.910
There is information that a threatening sentence was flying around.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.910
In my place... No threat.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.430
Hey, can I go to brother's house?

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.920
Eh ~ It's annoying.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.460
Then we will still play in the park.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.510
Uhm... When I was protected...
You were there, weren't you?

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.430
Yes, il'm Mizuki of Sumida Station.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.920
Can you delivered message to my mom?
To tell her I'm fine.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.100
I got it.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.410
I'm used to school

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.910
I'm doing a lot of experimentation.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.000
We met at this park by chance.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.780
Is he Enomoto's child?

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.910
Yeah well... what about the incident?

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.430
I read daily newspapers.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.910
Ahh….

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.930
But he's a very honest child
I am relieved.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.410
That brat...

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.910
Why are you here?

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.430
I'm really sorry. I had you come often.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.520
No...
Did you remember about Nana Tezuka?

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.900
So what about Akaike-san?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.940
Mr. Ukida.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.510
There is a possibility
that everyone is killed by the same criminal.

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.010
Uh….
So what about Hosokawa Asao?

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.080
Please don't kill this person by mistake.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:45.430
It's fragmentary but I remembered something.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.950
Yes.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.040
It is a large and bright place.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.020
I'm swinging golf.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.440
At that time, two women called out...

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.410
Is that Nana-chan?
Another one?

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.910
No….

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.920
RIKACO and Yuki Matsushita.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.920
- What?
- So why

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.310
I was asked if the appeal performance
was a golf swinging...

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.460
It maybe

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.550
Isn't this about the
Junon Superboy contest?

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.420
That's right!
Those two are judges...

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.440
Mr. Kuzumi!

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.440
You're not Yoshihiko Hamada!

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.970
Then...

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.560
None of that Grand Prix?

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.320
- Huh….
- Tezuka-san?

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.440
Ah….

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.430
So as soon as I woke up,
You called Nana.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.420
Yes.
At that time, she said, “I'll be right there.”

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.940
The shift was over, so I went home.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.460
But the next day

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.610
I heard you didn't see your wife yet...

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.530
Can't answer the phone right now.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.410
If you have a job request...

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.430
I only left a message.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.930
If you ask later, then...

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.570
Did you meet Nana-chan?

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.930
Of course.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.040
Mrs.?

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.940
Ah... yes
I need to lie down and rest a little

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.780
Mrs. would falls down before
your husband wakes up

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.430
But...

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.530
If no one is around when he wake up

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.270
Shota-kun would feel very lonely

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.800
She was holding your hand.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.460
I can't hear anything.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.950
Mr. Kuzumi, excuse me.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.930
Did you take medicine properly?

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.420
Hey!

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.410
This is bad, Akane-san.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.410
- Did you follow me?
- Yes.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.430
Akane-san is easy to follow from behind.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.910
- Go home.
- No, it's a crime.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.900
It will be exciting scene in a book.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.490
- If you write about trespassing...
- Because I am a non-fiction writer.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.920
Stop... Good!

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.910
- Let me go!
- Be quiet.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.410
Let me go...!

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.920
- Yes.
- It is a courier service.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.920
- Please ~

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.450
“I'm on the sofa.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.000
I want to hang out with you

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.420
"I have hope."

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.420
- It was for you.
- Ah... Yeah.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.450
This is….

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.590
I wrote the name of a man named Takafumi Kono

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.590
Mr. Kono

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.410
- What is it?
- That's nothing.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.500
No way... This is Kono's name tag...?

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.020
Forget that.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.540
Oh this!

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.410
Creepy.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.900
No! In the next play, as a high school student...

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.940
Isn't this an affair?

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.580
- Compensation calculation...
- Kimiko!

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.310
I will do it thoroughly.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:53.770
First, leave this house now.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.270
Please drown at the right time!

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.260
Oh...!

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.920
Then Kuroshima was angry.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.160
Yes, I was so rude?

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.190
Yes, it's rude.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.950
But that's it, right?
Having lunch with Kuroshima-chan.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:17.270
- You didn't say anything, did you?
- No, why is that?

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.950
You can talk to me about love

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.920
And what we're not going to talk about
It's rude

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.390
I didn't talk about love.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.940
Did you kiss?

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.500
- No. Nothing like that.
- Maybe at the festival?

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.420
- I will not!
- If you get so nervous

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.420
It's obvious. You really like her.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.040
Hahahaha...!

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.410
Hit the nail on the head.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.430
Ahaha... Tears came out...

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.730
- You're laughing too much.
- Yeah... ha ha ha ha...

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.650
Yup….

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.640
Ah... That...?

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.410
Sorry.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.900
I have fun

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.970
It reminds me of Nana-chan right away.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.440
Sorry...

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.010
Little by little from this room

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.500
Nana-chan's smell would disappear

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.530
I can't open the closet yet.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.050
Nana's smell...

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.500
Ah…!

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.500
I'll fix it in no time!
Give me 1 year

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.480
Even though I told you I'd fix it.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.530
Nana-chan, when did this happen?

- Eh, Are you sure?
- This one

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.950
Doyan will take it.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.900
Why don't you give it to her?

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.920
- Yes yes... Doyan's turn.
- Wait a minute...

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.930
Ah! It's time for me to replace the caller.
Sorry, I'm going.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:38.980
I'll leave you two alone.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.610
- Huh?
- Huh…?

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.890
Today I'm not going to talk about Yamagiwa.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.900
Not as a suspect but as a mother.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.920
- Do you have any concerns?
- How about So-chan?

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:03.920
- He wanted to tell his mother.
- Did you meet?

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.990
What is it? It's about science class.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:10.000
I'm really excited to do the experiment.

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:14.930
Speaking of experiments, Soichi used to have them at school.

Thank you for today.

Oh, your pocket money is in your bag

And then this is for Soichi.
Oh... I'm sorry.

- You're good at ring throwing.
- No... it's just a fluke.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.910
If it's a fluke, it's even more precious.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.930
I'm glad...

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.930
- Ouch...
- Are you okay?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.420
It's worn out...

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.420
I think I twisted it a little.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.420
I'm sorry.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.400
No….

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.410
How is my wife?

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:49.910
She's a little tired.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.780
Well, she laughed after that,
so I think it's okay.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.900
Something must have been triggered.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.970
- Is it an “experiment”?
- Experiment?

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.910
Yes, it's a message from Soichi.
"Do my best in experiments" he said.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.410
- Do my best?
- What is it?

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.910
- NO.
- That…. Kamiya….

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:11.910
- Catch Soichi.
- Yes?

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:14.400
It has to be stopped!
Arrest him!

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.120
- What was that sudden?
- Soichi is...

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.470
Soichi is...

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.970
He is not an ordinary child.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.550
- Have you seen what I did.
- I was watching, but...

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.050
I saw you but no…

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.500
Wasshoi

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.460
I thought it was an accident
that happened while they were playing.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:50.900
But all the children that were with them
said that was intentional.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.640
When we confronted him...

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.830
- Experiment?
- Yes, it's an experiment

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.500
I wanted to see

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500
When the dead die

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.420
In fact, there was a sign.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.280
He killed the chicken.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.420
- How about it?
- It's delicious!

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.900
Organic grilled corn!

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.420
You're doing great.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.970
Thanks.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.910
You're doing great too
and don't mess up.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.410
- It's delicious!
- There are other

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.290
Repeated attacks on insects and stray cats.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.770
My wife said, “At this rate

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.920
"He might do something to classmates again."

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.020
It's going crazy...

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.580
Ah...! Ahh…

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.990
What are you doing!
Stop it!

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.080
Kill So-chan then I will die too.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.000
- Sanae!
- Impossible!

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.500
Mom could never do something like killing a man.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:04.430
Between a crazy son and a crazy wife

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:07.930
I was still thinking about protecting myself.

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.420
If Soichi did something,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.420
I would lose my promotion.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.450
So I agreed on my wife's crazy proposal

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.810
We decided to keep Soichi away from the world.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.060
But this plan broke down in no time.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.020
- Ou
- Manager…

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.070
I heard a rumor that you kept a pet, so I came to see it.

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:35.570
No, no...!
That no... Nothing, nothing...!

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.510
- What's going on here?
- I'm sorry...!

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.010
Please! Don't open...

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.520
Oops... A large dog?

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.420
Haa…

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.440
He knew something was wrong.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.010
She was asked for hush money.
While obeying it reluctantly

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:02.450
In the murder-swap game, my wife just wrote “Property Manager”

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.450
He was really killed...

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.980
Then she was forced to continue the game...

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.960
Please wait!

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.960
We're talking
about a very important thing... Eh?

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.960
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.930
Um... I was suddenly called by Professor Hayakawa.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.900
Ahh….

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.950
Is it okay? Do you want me to accompany you?

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:36.950
It's okay.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.920
In other words, someone threaten with
the story of Soichi-kun...

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.300
So my wife drew the paper with Dr. Yamagiwa name.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.850
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.020
- I ran over a dog there.
- Even if I tell you...

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.140
You're a doctor, right?

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.820
- That appeared on TV…
- Ah...

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.500
I understand

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.100
Eh?

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.790
That was what my wife did alone.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:29.420
When I noticed, I had to cooperate.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.410
Even if you think the matter is over

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.520
This time she can't stand to bear her sins alone.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.600
To increase the number of accomplices...

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.440
Uwa!

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.030
She started to threaten Fujii,
just like when she was threatened.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.060
About the incident, it doesn't matter what you get

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.970
- And Soichi's involvement is….
- That...

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:00.060
To delay identification of Yamagiwa

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500
That child went out without permission.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.940
He's a child who can do anything even with a severed head!

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.440
- Contact the guardian immediately!
- Yes.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.950
So-chan.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.160
So-chan...

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:24.930
I hate experimenting alone...

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.050
Mom will experiment too...

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.200
Uhu... Huhuhu...!

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.440
Even if it's time they still haven't come back.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.980
Yes, two people,
5 years old and a junior high school boy.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.510
Uh….

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.930
What about you?
Oh... So, did you see Soichi?

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.430
No….

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.920
Yes, please.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.920
I told the police.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.490
The kids are gone.

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.060
The culprit commits murder in search of pleasure

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.470
How about Kuroshima-chan?

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.530
Ah, suddenly went to university...

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.920
We'll go manually search!

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.420
- Excuse me, please.
- Let's go.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.930
Excuse me.

Why are you so worried?

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.400
There is no time to explain to you!

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.020
That explained enough.

- It's okay.
- But...

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.910
Because she won't see you again.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:43.670

No, I can't contact Masako.

Soon the train will be on Line 2.

Please stand outside of the yellow line.
