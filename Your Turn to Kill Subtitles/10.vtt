He left this morning as usual.

Shota? Your gym called.
Are you okay?

Call me at once

Did Sanae do something?

Either way, it means
Sanae killed someone.

Why did you peek inside?

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.950
I thought
they were hiding something.

Oh? He has gone missing?

You must be worried.
How long has he been missing?

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.920
I did apologise to
Sanae and her husband.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.880
He hasn't been home
since last night.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.240
Have you seen him, Sanae?

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.080
I am sorry, but l haven't.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.080
Hang on, l'll help you look for him.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.320

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.790
He...

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.840
l think he is Sanae's son.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.040
What?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.080
They have a son?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.760
Do you remember that
there was once before...

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.320
Daddy.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.520
I didn't find it strange
at that time,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.040
but when l think about it,
calling him "daddy"...

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.560
Even so...

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.680
why do they hide him?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.840
Rather than "hiding,"
it's more like confinement.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.560
Let's escape together.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.600
What should we call you?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.480
Please tell us your name.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.600
I just think maybe
someone will come to rescue us.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.560
This room is probably soundproof.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.480
Am l noisy?

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.280
I am sorry.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.790
Has Shota ever
ditched work before?

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.870
No.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.010
I hope he isn't involved
in anything scary.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.080
- A torch?
- Yes.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.400
I was on my way
to the convenience store.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.640
I thought
it should be Sanae's flat,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.560
so l counted from
the ground floor to check.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.960
Kuroshima, please come in!

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.480
Then, right after
l entered the flat...

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.490
Oh? l thought it'd make people
pass out right away.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.810
Sanae!

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.130
Does the boy have anything to do
with the murder-swap?

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.410
I have no idea.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.630
Can you call anyone here?

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.030
How did he go out to the balcony?

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.110
You are Sanae's son, right?

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.210
This isn't all right.
l promise, l'll save you.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.230

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.120

- Well...
- Yes?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.260
Looking for him like this
won't get us anywhere,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.660
so let's go back for now
and talk about what we'll do.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.020
Sure. Okay.

if possible, let's go to yours--

lsn't it better to ask for
the police's help?

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.130
My mum isn't a bad person.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.610

Mum! Let me out!

that might cause him to go missing?

the right division
to talk to about this?

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.790
Of course, you request for a search
of missing person at our division.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.080
However, we cannot intervene
if it is a civil case.

because you had a fight,

then the police...

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.200
The two of them
can't possibly have a fight.

of a criminal nature or not.

Even if you ask for a search,
the request might not be accepted.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.110
Even if it is, the police
won't conduct a proper search.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.570

It's okay, he's just doing his job.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:32.510
If you mean physically,
my eyes see you currently,

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.150
so l don't see Shota.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.830
But l always look at Shota fondly
in my mind.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.550
Okay. Thank you.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.240
Wait.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.640
You look tired.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.590
- I'll massage your ear lobes.
- No, thanks.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.990
I am sorry.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.470
It feels good though.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.120
See you.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.590
Shota and l walk to
the train station every morning,

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.030
but he didn't today.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.110
Has Shota gone missing?

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.950
No, he will be back soon.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.030
You will be alone at home
for a while, won't you?

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.470
I said, he'll soon...

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.190
Welcome.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.390
Sorry, l am late.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.230
I've been wondering. ls it a play?

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.550
5,000 yen including
the ticket for the first play.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.550
Yes?

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.200
You didn't have to sell it yourself.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.950
We want an audience.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.070
Mr Tamiya, you can make up for
any loss with your pocket money.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.120
Drama is an art that only exists
if the creators and the audience

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.710
share the same period of time.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.510
You can't spend time like that
watching a film or reading a book.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.560
The audience enjoy the finished work
of the creators--

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.220
l've learned a lot from you.
See you.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.100
But my beer hasn't come.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.020
Well... no.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.700
Is it about Kono?

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.700
Mr Kono!

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.030
Regarding that,
l do feel a bit guilty about it.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.110
I can guess who the murderer was.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.230
What?

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.070
I'm going to make
the murderer pay for that.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.490
"Shota"

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.850
Your call cannot be answered right
now, please leave a message...

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.210
- What's the matter?
- l'm sorry.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.290
My husband has gone missing
since this morning.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.770
What?

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.400
He didn't go to work either.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.640
Is this related to the game?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.720
I don't know.
l submitted a request for a search.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.610
But l'm still worried,
so l'm calling you.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.010
Who did you give it to?

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.690
Community Safety Division's
Mr Enomoto.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.290
So...

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.610
Yes?

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.490
But there is something
l'm worried about.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.170
It's okay even if it's late,
so can we meet?

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.170
"Automatic number-plate recognition
matching report

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.610
Vehicle (TKA370 O 40-23)"

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.970
"For lsehara"

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.880
All right.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.930
I have to do something
in your neighbourhood too.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.810
I'll come to you.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.610
Thank you.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.010
"For lsehara at 23:21
TKA307 O 4023"

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:29.090
Everyone still thinks
the murder-swap is going on.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.130
Just showing them that
l'm looking for the murderer

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.610
can act as a deterrent.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.330
If Shota found out something that
let him to identify the murderer,</i>

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.610
and that got him into trouble,</i>

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.290
then the likely suspects
are Mr Fujii and...</i>

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.010
"Sanae"

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.570
Maybe there's some kind of trouble

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.090
between the caretaker
and the chairlady.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.210
"Chairlady, no money is deposited.
Why? l'll show them the photo!"

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.370
"First boyfriend"

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.060
"The caretaker?"

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.460
The person who wrote the caretaker
was probably...

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.900
"Murderer A, threatens?
The person who wrote caretaker"

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.860
The person who killed
Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.420
"Where is Dr Yamagiwa's head?"

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.510
"Still Unsolved,
Dr Yamagiwa's Murder"

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.750
"After he was murdered,

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:38.670
his body was moved to a mountain
in lsehara, Kanagawa Prefecture."

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.190
The murderer couldn't have
transported the body by taxi.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.430
Sanae?

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.590
Backing a car is difficult
until you get used to it.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.830
Sanae's car...

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.140
Excuse me.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.710
l am really sorry, but...

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.980
would you let me see
what is in that box?

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.500
You know there have been
murders, right?

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.260
I'm not suspecting you, but...

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.460
Sorry, and thank you.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.950
Good evening.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.870
Good evening.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.450
Excuse me.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.570
Yes?

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.470
Have you seen the car here?

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.310
The chairlady's?

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.150
She used to practise
how to back in her car.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.890
Yes. Have you seen her car lately?

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.530
I will go buy something else.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.430
Speaking of which, she's been using
her bicycle for a while ago.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.550
Thank you.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.690
But we can't get rid of
so many people.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.270
Then...

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.860
Should we just let the two of them
live in the room?

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:05.050
Well, Soichi needs some friends
as well.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.370
- Yes!
- Don't nod!

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.610
It's difficult to kill them both
at once, so let's do it one by one.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.090
Don't say such scary stuff.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.610
But it is scary!

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.410
It is scary, but we're doing this
for Sou!

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.890
Let's divide the work.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.530
I'll kill Kuroshima, and you--

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.450
l have to kill too?

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.330
You should share some of
the household chores with me.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.090
Fine, from now on,
l'll do the cleaning and laundry,

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.530
so you'll kill them both.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.930
What?

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.250
What the heck?

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:42.650
We've never had a conversation like
this since we've first met!

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.210
Pull yourself together.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.570
What's the matter?

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:50.630
We can't do this alone.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.220
Where are you now?

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.260
I understand that
you want to protect your mum,

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.470
but if you do,
let's leave all the more.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.550
Or the matter will get
even more serious!

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.990
Will you look for something
that can untie and uncuff me?

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.550
What should l tell her?

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.430
What... What's the matter?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.390
Mr Fujii...

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.620
You've been threatened since
Yutaro Yamagiwa was killed, right?

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.380
What? Yes...

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.190
ls it possible that Sanae did that?

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.020
The chairlady? Why do you ask?

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.610
I think Sanae wrote
the Caretaker's name

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.510
So she was threatened,
and killed Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.670
Really?

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.390
To verify, l need to know
who you'd threatened.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.950
I want some clue.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.250
Hello, Mr Atsushi Fujii,

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.590
it is your turn to kill!

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.670
Darn, l deleted it.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.340
Wait, l kept the threatening notes.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.230
No, l think l threw them away.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.950
Please look for them!
l'll compare the handwriting.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.050
No, l threw them away.
So l'm sorry, please leave.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.190
Good night.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.350
"It is your turn to kill"

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.710
She might find out what l did too.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.270
Anyway...

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:53.110
when will she stop prying into this?

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.110
Anything will do.

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.750
But l don't think
they'd put any tool here

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.480
to prevent him from escaping.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.630
What is in that box?

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.110
I was told not to open it.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.490
Will you open it and look inside?

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.370
What is it?

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.440
I don't really know.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.920
What...

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.440
No!

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.080
Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.210
Mr Kamiya, have you finished work?

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.970
I'm expecting your call.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.810
How long has it been here?

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:25.080
I don't remember clearly,
but it was more than a month ago.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.400
I see.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.640
Will my mum be arrested?

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.220
Yes, she will.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:46.480
Tell me, why do you think your mum
might be arrested, but not your dad?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.480
The other day...

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.520
Why did you do that?

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.680
I didn't know what to do either...

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.920
lf you didn't know what to do,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.520
you should've talked to me!

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.360
But at this rate, Sou will...

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.280
Your voice...

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.680
Your voice.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.800
After that, l heard the two of them
went out in the middle of the night.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.880
Then, after a while...

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.320
Do not open this, okay?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.870
I'm sorry, Sou.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:37.750
So you did what they said?

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.590
I had a feeling that
something bad was inside,

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.830
so l didn't want to know.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.830
"New message from Kamiya"

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.350
"l have to handle something urgent,
so l cannot come."

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.830
"lncoming call: Nana Tezuka"

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.910
Excuse me, Mr Kamiya.
Where are you now?

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.950
I am very sorry,
but my matter is urgent too.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.230
Over here.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.970
Gosh!

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.890
Blindfold them!

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:02.450
Well, we'll do that anyway.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.530
I won't do that.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.850
I've explained myself clearly.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.970
Why did you come if you won't do it?

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.010
You said you'd expose my secret,
so l had to!

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.850
Yes, if l am arrested,

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.950
l'll tell them everything you did
two years ago.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.370
A detective gave information to
a suspect he was investigating,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.030
and took 500,000 yen.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.710
It was 1.5 million. l wouldn't take
the risk for so little!

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:33.950
The amount doesn't matter.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.270
Be quiet.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.120
I'll only be punished and dismissed
even if they know,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.720
but when you first threatened me,

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.480
you told me to get rid of all data
about the game, so l said yes.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.480
Now you're asking too much!

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.640
You've been hiding something from me
since the beginning.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.320
The two of you
killed Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.240
"TKA370 O 40-23"

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.910
l figured it out using the N System.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.950
I used the data of your car,
so l found it first...

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.520
but Kanagawa's prefectural police
will realise it soon.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.760
There is an empty flat
on the third floor.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:49.120
Just move them there one by one--

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.440
l said...

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.720
We'll be in trouble
if they find blood here.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.520
We'll be in trouble anyway!

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.080
I need three people,
including someone to keep watch.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.240
If you do just that,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.120
no matter what happens later,
l won't say anything.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.200
I'll give you three minutes.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.080
Think what the best option is.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.400
This is the only way.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.300
Hey.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.060
I make my decisions quickly.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.310
Don't ask anything.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.090
You're asking too much.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.360
Sorry that we have to talk here.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.080
I can do this at the police station.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.080
I just thought
she was hiding something.</i>

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.440
Hurry up!

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.940
The key...

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.060
"Master key"

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.260
Why have you gotten this?

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:23.580
What?

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.260
Nana?

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.860
Shota?

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.300
Shota!

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.500
Nana! Please, uncuff me.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.540
This is bad. Kuroshima...

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.660
Why? ls she here?

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.820
They took her somewhere.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.500
Who is he?

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.830
Sanae!

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.150
- Wait...
- Hurry up!

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.870
All right...

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.390
Run!

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.150
Nana!

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:28.350
Call someone here!

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.820
Someone, please!

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.580
Help us! Help!

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.500
Help!

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.980
How should l shut you up?

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.390
Yutaro Yamagiwa was in my car's boot
at that time,

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:58.430
so you are my accomplice!

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.270
Right? Will you shut up now?

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:03.950
Got a problem?

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.590
I am really sorry.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:09.420
I do this for my son!

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.300
Who cares, this isn't right!

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.230
You won't understand,
because you aren't a mother!

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:20.700
It doesn't matter who l sacrifice,
l have to protect those l love!

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.180
Catch her!

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.940
- What's going on?
- Come with us.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.580
Thank you. Wait here.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.900
Wait...

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.180
Apologising won't help!

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.220
No...

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.190
ldiot! Don't do it here!

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.630
Kamiya, help us! Kami--

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.750
That jerk!

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.110
- Don't come here!
- What?

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:14.710
- Help!
- Sorry, it got just out of control.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:15.750
Gosh, Mrs Enomoto!

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:16.990
But you're the police!

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.030
What happened?

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.590
I said, it's a blender!

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.950
What you use to make smoothie!

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.750
She's using it... Just come now!

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.710
- Nana!
- Shota!

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:29.230
Sanae, let's give up.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.150
Don't worry, Masashi!

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.910
I'll take care of this!

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:34.070
What?

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.430
Now, listen to me!

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:44.150
Look carefully
at the blender's blades!

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.310
What?

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.230
Concentrate!

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.270
When the blender stops,

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:57.350
you will forget
what you are seeing now!

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.750
What are you talking about?

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.990
That's enough...

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.710
Please!

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.350
Forget what you see!

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.450
Look carefully at this!

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.870
I beg you!

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.870
- Sanae!
- Don't come here!

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.710
If you come any closer,
l'll kill Nana, and then myself!

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.150
Sanae...

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.430
What's going on?

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.170
Don't do this.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:40.450
Who is that?

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.330
Sou!

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:44.250
Soichi!

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.770
Mum, l'll jump off here
if you don't stop!

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.070
What? "Mum"?

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.140
His mother?

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.420
Get off there. lt's dangerous!

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.470
Let the lady go, then!

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.750
- Nana!
- Shota...

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:20.740
Soichi, get off there!

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:44.860
Shota!

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.660
- Soichi!
- Shota!

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.820
Sou! Sou...

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:50.860
Sou!

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.510
You haven't forgotten
what you promised, right?

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:57.550
Well...

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.230
Fried pork with tartar sauce.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:06.310
Shota!

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.490
Shota!

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.190
Nana?

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:37.750
Excuse me, l'm Sumida Police
Station's Mizuki.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.930
What?

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.610
You mean every day...

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.530
Mrs Tezuka stays here so long,
l worried that she'd get ill.

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:53.290
Wow... l miss her so much!

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.930
About Sanae Enomoto...

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.040
You can't ask him that yet.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.240
But...

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.460
Ask him after the doctor approves.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.180
Please leave for now.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.660
Come on!

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.780
"Housewife Attempted Murder
with A Hand Blender..."

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.460
"Doctor Yamagiwa's head found!"

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.380
"Suspect, Sanae Enomoto is arrested
for attempted murder,

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.540
but she remains silent
about Doctor Yamagiwa's murder."

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.540
"The boy who fell
only has minor injuries

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.340
and has been discharged
from the hospital.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:35.520
He is staying at a children's home."

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.520
Mr Tezuka, l'll come in now.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.670
"Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital"

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.330
Oh, you're right where l want you.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.250
Mr Tezuka?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.490
You shouldn't walk yet!

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.770
I want to call back home.
May l borrow 10 yen?

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.330
Mrs Tezuka called us. She will come
when she finishes work.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.650
Now return to your room.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:27.810
Okay.

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:37.810
Sorry.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.850
I'll just take my wallet
and be back at once.

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.330
I might keep you waiting here
for a bit. See you later.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.410
My key...

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.010
Shota, are you okay?

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.530
And are you okay?

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.610
They only tied me up.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.130
You've been discharged already?

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:02.370
I sneaked out of there.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.130
I want to see Nana as soon as l can.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:05.450
You must miss her.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.330
But not only that.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:13.530
I want to propose to her again
as soon as l can.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.340
I think Nana will be happy.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.250
- Don't tell her. lt's a surprise.
- Okay.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:26.170
Please record the memorable moment
for the both of us.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.450
Yes?

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.370
Now, after hundreds of years,

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:41.250
l am going to see Nana again!

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.530
Oh? lt isn't locked.

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:54.090
After so many things happened...
Nana is too careless!

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.410
Please come in...

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.610
Be quiet.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.460
She isn't in her office.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.860
She'll shout at me later.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.940
Let's go.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.890
Oh?

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.450
Not here.

00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:33.650
We really are going to surprise her
by waking her up!

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:47.970
Here l go.
