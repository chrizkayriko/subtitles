00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.950
"Everyone must have someone
they want to kill."</i>

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.540
l think this is what started it.</i>

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.980
We wrote the name of the person
we want to kill half-jokingly,</i>

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.040
"Asao Hosokawa"
<i>and secretly showed each other.</i>

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.420
Right after that...</i>

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.620
The name l wrote was
Yutaro Yamagiwa.</i>

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.180
People are murdered
one after next...</i>

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.100
"Masao Tanaka"

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.900
They said he got a note that says,
"lt is your turn to kill!"

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.180
People are cornered...</i>

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.460
The name l wrote
on my piece of paper

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.860
was Misato Akaike.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.340
I heard you played a dangerous
game at the residents' meeting.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.340
You knew?

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.900
I think we should tell the police
about the game.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.820
But still...</i>

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.580
Maybe we would all be treated
as a murderer for a while.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
I did nothing, so l don't want to be
treated as an accomplice!

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.780
We didn't talk to the police...</i>

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.100
l wrote on the ballot paper that
l wanted to kill Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.820
And one more person died.</i>

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.150
"Yoshihiko Hakamada"

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.450
"Episode 6"

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.810
Don't panic, loser.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.130
Sorry.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Also,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.020
that isn't the only problem.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.340
Thank you.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.150
Big Bro.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.630
You startled me...

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.790
What's the matter?

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.750
I saw you.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.150
You went to meet Nana, right?

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.070
Calm down.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.430
Anyway, when did you know her?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.350
You hit on her?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.820
But you're married, right?

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.180
Yeah...

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.420
Well, Nana is pretty,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.820
so l can understand why
you want to make a move on her.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.390
But you shouldn't.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.870
Nana is my wife!

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.110
Oh, is she?

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.430
Well, l am happy that
my wife is popular,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.150
but l had no idea that you...

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.510
l think we do get along, right?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.110
We even have the same taste
in women! The same!

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.670
Your wife is popular,
doesn't it worry you?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990
One worries because
he hasn't had enough training.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.390
It's a different matter.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.270
No, it's image training.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.950
"If my beloved wife has an affair."
That's the image training l do.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.870
In the end, my plan is to love
Nana more than anyone else.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.390
It's the only one l have.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.350
What the heck?

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.870
Even if you're serious about
pursuing Nana,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.310
l'll just give her even more love
than you do.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.180
We worked together for a while,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.940
then we met again after a long time.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.590
I had no idea
that she was your wife.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.230
What? "l had no idea"?

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:29.510
What?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.910
It should be,
"l had no idea, sorry," right?

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.150
Sorry.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.590
Okay, we're friends again.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.630
We'll give you the latest update
on the case.</i>

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.270
In 1991, when Mr Yoshihiko Hakamada
was 18 years old,</i>

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.110
he won the Junon Super Boy Contest
Grand Prix Award...</i>

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.030
When l was slim,
people said l looked quite like him.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.750
I think l've seen him somewhere.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.790
Hey, it's Yoshihiko Hakamada!
You don't know him?

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.390
That's not what l mean.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.230
Look, it's him!

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.140
"101 Yuzuru Kuzumi"

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.120
He looks like him...

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.000
Wait, it's that condo again?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.720
Well, we'll concentrate on our case.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.200
"Murder of Kuramae Condo's Couple"
What's your current recommendation?

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.640
"Recommendation"?

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.080
This guy, l think.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.760
I still can't verify his alibi

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.890
on the night
Mr and Mrs Akaike were killed.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.520
"Room 203, Xinyi Lin,
student from China"

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.030
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.460
lt isn't your fault, Mr Kuzumi.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.580
lt's obviously my fault.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.670
It's because l wrote
Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.430
I kept wishing him dead,

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.480
but l actually think that
he's a very good actor.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.200
I think he was a good actor.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.680
Who drew your ballot paper?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.320
Yoshihiko Hakamada was a good actor!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Mr Kuzumi.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.120
I'm sorry.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.760
Are you threatened by anyone?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.440
What?

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.840
LIke when Mr Fujii was threatened.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.200
No, l haven't received any notes.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.240
Moreover, l don't know the man
whose name was on my paper,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.400
so how can l kill him?

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.600
Will you show me
the piece of paper again?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.120
Sure.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.720
It's "Asao Hosokawa", l presume?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.440
Yes, the first name is Asao.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.720
Yes?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.520
I wrote the name.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240
What?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.670
So, please, don't kill him.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.960
If anyone threatens you,
please talk to me.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.240
Mr Kuzumi?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.680
All of these aren't a trap you set,
right? Or are they?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.240
Suddenly, people started dying
the day you moved here.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.000
The property manager died
on the very same day you came.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.320
I am home!

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.040
I'm home...

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.080
Oh? Mr Kuzumi? What's the matter?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.640
You hit on her?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.880
What?

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.280
No, we're talking about the game.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.560
Oh... The murder-swap.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.320
They obviously are going to
make a deal with someone.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.960
What did they carry here?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.560
Someone is here.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.120
What is going on?

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.160
"Asao Hosokawa"
Wait a minute.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.320
I am this man's trainer!

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.640
He told me.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.360
Big Bro will be shocked
if he's killed for hitting on you.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.840
Hit on me?

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.640
That's how you knew him, right?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.520
No?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.360
- I...
- Wait... l'll guess.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.520
Orangutan Time.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.480
Nana, you're actually...

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.720
Married.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.960
To him.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.760
What?

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.960
I am sorry.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.480
Sorry, l don't get it at all.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.200
Who is married to whom?

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.920
You've asked me to
register our marriage many times,

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.000
but l still haven't, right?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.000
Because l can't.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.360
I'm still married to him
on the marriage records.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.750
Should l leave you two alone?

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.550
No! Please stay here.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.070
I... I'm a bit upset
if no one else is here.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.550
Wait, but...

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.710
May l hold your hand?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.310
Go on.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.680
I think l told you
that l was divorced,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.640
and that my ex-husband is Mr Hosokawa.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.560
He's the managing director
of my previous design company

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.520
and he was a nice man.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.160
But many things happened
after we got married,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.920
- so we decided to get divorced.
- Many things?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.520
Sorry, may l finish this first?

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.120
Yeah... Go ahead.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.520
There was one thing that
l could never forgive him for...

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.840
ls it many or just one?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.160
Sorry... I'm listening.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.600
We decided to get divorced,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.800
but he said
he didn't want to see me,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.920
and asked me to post him
the divorce form.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.280
So l did what he asked
and let him submit the form.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.800
Then, when l went to
renew my driver's licence,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.350
l found out that
the form wasn't submitted.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.000
Did you tell Big Bro?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.000
I told him over and over again,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.560
but he made up excuses every time
and avoided the topic.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.040
Shota, after you proposed to me,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.440
l told him that
l wanted to marry someone.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.280
He accepted it at the time,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.160
but he still didn't submit the form.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.320
Of course,
it was partly my fault too.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.320
After l started working freelance,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.040
l still took jobs from his company.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.640
So when l think
about our future life,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.120
l just couldn't insist.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.070
Ouch! lt hurts.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.170
I am sorry!
l know they are all excuses.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.080
Yes!

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.890
- It's a bull's eye!
- Yes?

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.390
It's been a while since l hit
the bull's eye at Orangutan Time!

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.990
What is it?

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.360
I was just going to say it.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.400
Your ex-husband is actually Big Bro,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.240
and you wrote his name!

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.640
Yes! l guessed it right.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.400
Shota...

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.720
Sorry.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.720
Shota, don't apologise.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.040
You've been worrying about
something so serious,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.280
but l had absolutely no idea.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.520
I'll kneel.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.230
I hurt my semitendinosus a bit
during training today,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.910
so l will just bow.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.430
I am sorry.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.110
I am really sorry.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.700
- So, Mr Kuzumi.
- Yes?

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.500
Please don't kill this man
by mistake!

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.740
Nana had loved him so much
that she was married to him once.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.060
I won't kill him, so may l go now?

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.850
"lt is your turn to kill"

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.610
lt has come already?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.380
"Obey the rules properly"

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.900
l met him the other day

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.140
because l didn't know
who drew my piece of paper.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.460
I just wanted to see if he was
attacked or harassed in any way.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.940
I understand now.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.660
So we're all good.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.740
Anyway, is anything else
worrying you?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.850
You might as well
tell me everything now.

"Room 302's occupant"

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.380
l think you might be killed.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.860
Telling him more might
turn my worries into reality,</i>

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.900
so l couldn't say it.</i>

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.380
It's fine.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.220
I see.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.660
Let's start from doing what we can.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.540
Is there anyone you can talk to?

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.940
Excuse me.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.820
Oh, detectives.
What's the matter today?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.780
We'd like to talk to her.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.740
Me?

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.490
Actually, Miss Seno's fingerprints
were left in the late Akaikes' flat.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.120
Well, we have done some digging.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.000
You brought the old lady home
when she fell from her wheelchair?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.560
Yes.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.210
So, where were kind Miss Seno
and the two gentlemen on that night?

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.220
The three of us went for...

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.460
- a car trip.
- Dinner.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.590
Oh? Which one?

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.990
We took a drive and had dinner.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.630
I see. Okay, then.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.950
"Kojima Kids English Class"

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.350
Mr Ukita.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.110
Should we worry about the police?

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.910
I'll take care of this.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.370
Sorry for making you do this for us.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.130
I don't do this for you two,
it's just for Airi.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.420
No, it isn't even for Airi either.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.740
It's for the promise l made
to her late mother.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.460
I won't let Airi have
a criminal record.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.300
And you should
pull yourself together.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.980
You'll marry her, right?

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.500
Yes. l am sorry.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.140
When will you be back next time?
Tell me!

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.020
You haven't been back for so long,
and you'll just leave now?

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.340
You told me to leave
in the first place.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.540
Right?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.620
What are you doing?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.180
You're crazy.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.460
What... Hey!

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.140
Trying to kill me?

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.500
I want children!

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.340
What? Whose?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.940
Between us!

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.660
It's too late to ask me.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.260
Let's start over again.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.900
You know that isn't the problem,
don't you?

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.900
We can go back!

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.300
If we have children, we can go back
to the happy days...

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.620
You're out of your mind.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.460
- I'll race you.
- No.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.850
- Why?
- Because you run faster than me.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.620
All right, then.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.660
l'll start two seconds later.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.700
Two seconds?

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.340
Fumi, Kazu.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.700
I made Bavarois. Let's have it.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.220
I am already full.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.740
Then, Kazu, let's have it.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.140
- Ouch!
- Come with me.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.260
It hurts! Let go of me!

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.500
Mummy!

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.660
Come with me!

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.660
Hey, what are you doing?

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.660
No!

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:11.980
Stay here.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.860
You...

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.940
Why?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.140
Why am l always the lonely one?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.850
Why are you all here so late?

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.770
We want to talk about the game.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.710
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.690
What do you do that for?

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.850
If we all know what name each person
wrote and who drew it,

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.490
then maybe we can prevent
more murders from happening.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.210
Although I'm not convinced that
none of you want to tell the police,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.450
l can understand.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.610
If anyone dies because of the game,

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.090
it's possible that everyone
participated is just as guilty.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:22.140
But doesn't it make you feel guilty
if you don't do anything?

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.940
I know what you mean,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.180
but there's no way to find out what
the caretaker and Mrs Akaike wrote.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.860
Yes, you are right, but...

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.380
We think that it isn't
totally useless.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:40.100
I didn't even tell my wife
about the game.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.700
I am sorry.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.460
It's fine.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:50.140
We hope you would convince the other
residents for us if possible.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.380
You mean everyone here
agrees on that?

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.980
Yes.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.980
I refuse.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.810
Please. lf you say it, they will...

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.740
All these years,
l've been meddlesome...

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.170
during the residents' meetings.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.410
But l won't be anymore.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.410
I want to use my time...

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.250
for my dream.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.220
What should we do?

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.060
I think we can only create
an opportunity to ask them again.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.270
Yeah, let's do that.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.430
I wonder what happened to Mr Tamiya.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.390
He is like a different person.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.510
We've made no progress at all.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.270
What should we do?

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.310
Nana, who do you think will be
next to get killed

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.830
in the murder-swap?

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.390
If there really is
a murder-swap going on,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.670
and it actually goes in that order,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.510
the person whose name you wrote
gets killed,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.950
then you get threatened,
and forced to kill the next target.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.590
And this is the result.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.110
That means Mr Ukita
killed Yoshihiko Hakamada?

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.310
"Ukita kills Yoshihiko Hakamada"

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.790
l don't know.
I'm not confident at all.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.630
The news said that
he was attacked by several people...

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.030
But Mr Ukita has two underlings.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.950
But you see, if Mrs Akaike was
killed by the Chinese girl, it's...

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.350
Sorry, let's stop this.
Most of these are groundless.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.510
I believe what you deduced.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.950
I think there are other things
that we should do.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.990
That's right, Big Bro.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.750
If he's killed,
you could be arrested too.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.070
Please don't kill this man
by mistake!

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.230
I think we can trust Mr Kuzumi.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:17.990
Anyway, you'll see him at the gym,
won't you?

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:19.710
What will you do?

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.550
I'll try to talk to him calmly.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.470
Shota! Shota!

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:43.110
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.270
Today, l made...

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.910
- Talk if you can keep up with me.
- Okay.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.750
- Do you drink protein shake daily?
- Yes.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.070
I made this protein shake myself!

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.070
Thanks.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.710
The milk is additive-free and--

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.390
l am happy, but you've been
giving me too many things,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.560
so can this be the last one?

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.600
Yes?

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.280
You see, l don't know what
thank-you gift to give girls,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.000
and l shouldn't take too much.
That's what Nana...

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.200
That's what my wife said.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.320
Thank you for this. See you.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.900
Is that so?

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.260
Big Bro!

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.380
You lied about hitting on her!

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.600
You said l hit on her yourself.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.190
Please break up with her!

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.390
Mr Tezuka!

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.400
Please break up with her!

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.240
Ouch!

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.320
You've trained me very hard.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.000
Listen, l am Nana's legal husband

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.740
and she is having
an affair with you.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.700
You even bought a flat
and live together,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.400
now you can't make up any excuse.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.810
If l sue you, you'll pay me
a large sum of alimony,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.070
and Nana will lose the job
that earns her money.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.030
You are nasty!

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.630
I've checked how much you earn too.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.350
You will both be ruined.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.000
I will still call you Big Bro.
Big Bro--

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.360
Well, we are brothers in a sense.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.480
You'll punch me?
Punch me and get fired!

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.350
Just so you know,

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.850
l love everything about Nana.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:12.170
I love Nana now and l will continue
to love her in the future,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:17.360
and that includes the time that
spans her whole life.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:18.810
In other words,

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:25.070
l even love the days that
Nana was living with you too.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.750
What are you talking about?

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.790
When l say l love Nana,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.710
l also mean that l love you too.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.370
You'll break me.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.250
Ow...

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.290
So l will protect you.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.090
What?

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.410
If you feel that someone wants to
kill you, tell me at once.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.530
Why would anyone want to kill me?

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.450
I told you about the game, right?

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.610
Nana wrote your name.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.690
My name?

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.130
But l will protect you.

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.210
I feel guilty
every time l watch the news.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.350
It isn't your fault, Mr Kuzumi.
lt's a coincidence.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:26.830
I want to think it is too!

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:28.550
Oh, darn!

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.110
"Names Revelation Meeting"

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.270
Nobody comes.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:42.150
I guess they really don't want to
tell others the names they wrote.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.910
Well, we have been
keeping ours a secret too.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.790
Why don't we tell each other now?

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:58.910
I will go first, then.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.030
I wrote...

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.260
"My first boyfriend."

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.260
Your first boyfriend? Why?

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.540
He had seen
my most embarrassing moments,

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.740
so l wanted him to die before
anyone finds out about my past.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.540
It is nothing serious!

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.020
On the train station platform...

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.620
l forced him to kiss me...

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.980
Well, l didn't write an actual name,

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.500
so l don't think he'll be killed.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.720
Indeed.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.160
By the way,
the ballot paper l drew says,

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.560
"People who don't give up
their seats on the train."

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.660
lt sounds like Mr Tamiya.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.300
Yeah, he doesn't accept
anything wrong.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.300
Sounds like
what Mr Tamiya would write.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.220
I wrote the name of the professor
of my university tutor group.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.110
His name is Hayakawa
and we're on very bad terms.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.950
I'm now in my third year,
but he already said

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:12.700
he would certainly make me repeat
no matter what thesis l write.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.100
How mean of him!

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.580
But l wrote "Professor",
it's obvious that l wrote it.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.900
Xinyi is a student too.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.860
But Xinyi probably wrote the owner
of the Bhutanese diner.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.780
Yeah.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:34.020
And l think l told you the name on
the piece of paper l drew,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.300
it was Oda Nobunaga.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.980
Who wrote the name as a joke?

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.910
But isn't the answer to this
quite clear?

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.700
It's someone who hates Nobunaga.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.940
Nobody does.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.620
Among the residents,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.790
there could be offspring of
lmagawa Yoshimoto or Takeda Shingen.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.750
I don't know much
about Japanese history.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:58.590
- Yes?
- Yes.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.110
What about you, Nana?

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.190
The piece of paper l drew says,

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.310
"Takafumi Kono", in Hiragana.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.510
- You don't know him?
- No.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.100
I don't know him either.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.660
And the name l wrote was...

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.660
Asao Hosokawa.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.710
And l drew the piece of paper.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.630
Who is that person?

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.050
He is...

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.570
lt's someone l knew at my work.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:31.850
Yes.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.930
The reason that Nana wants
my acquaintance to die...

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.110
Well, it's a secret,

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.790
but it's just a side of her
that you haven't seen before.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.470
This is Black Nana.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.230
Yes.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.510
Yes.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.830
Ms Kitagawa.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.190
Hello.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.420
l think it's time to
tell Mr Ukita everything.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.980
It's still early.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.590
I wouldn't tell him if l could.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.990
But l think the police has realised.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.030
What?

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.530
- So what?
- So Mr Ukita...

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:19.380
You do know what matters most now,
don't you?

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:21.980
Yes.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.220
I'm off to work.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.820
I understand why the other people
don't want to come,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.340
it's possible that we'd be
in the same room

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:39.900
with whoever murdered
Mr and Mrs Akaike.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.140
Are you not afraid, Ms Kitagawa?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.210
I...

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:51.500
l came here for my son.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.970
I fear that it could even harm Sora
at this rate.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.220
Well, among those who participated
in the game,

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.580
there shouldn't be anyone
who would harm Sora.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.500
What do you mean?

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.900
The name l wrote
on the ballot paper...

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.860
was Mrs Kayo Kojima.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.820
"Kayo Kojima"

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.660
l didn't want to say that l wrote
the name of our neighbour,

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.300
but l think you all know that
she isn't in her right mind, right?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.260
Yasu said he was afraid
to be on his own, so l...

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.750
This woman called Sora "Yasu"!

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.940
She gave him another name and
calls him that! This isn't right!

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.220
It's my fault that
l can't look after Sora well,

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.000
but l didn't want to kill her!
I'm regretting this.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.200
I understand. l did the same thing.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.680
Please, tell me what is going on.

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.560
We don't know that too.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.480
By the way, what is written on
the piece of paper you drew?

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.240
Well...

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.240
l'll say this first.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.680
I was...

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.160
a bit taken aback.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.640
Taken aback?

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.550
Nothing is written.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.950
Yes, the piece of paper is blank.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.750
But I'm glad that it is blank!

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.470
Although l wasn't serious,

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.750
l still shouldn't have written
the name of someone l want to kill!

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:02.790
Mrs lshizaki also said that
she wrote her own name.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.750
You wrote a name easily and
there's something wrong with you!

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.580
It makes me think that
I'm a horrible person,</i>

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.620
and it makes me sad.</i>

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.080
Oh? You are still here?

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.000
Sorry, l applied for a day off
next Thursday to go golfing,

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.960
so l have to work.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.800
Go golfing on a weekday?
Well-off, aren't you?

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.000
I'm not well-off, that's why l go
on a weekday, because it's cheap.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.920
I see.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.800
- Have a good evening.
- Have a good evening.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.720
Darn...

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.240
l forgot them there.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.840
I don't want to go.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.800
"Email from Toshiaki. No subject"

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.080
"Will you send my golf clubs
to my office by post?"

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.960
- What is it?
- Well...

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.800
l'm just wondering what you think
about Airi and l getting married.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.600
I'm happy, of course.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.280
Besides the fact that
you'll be her husband.

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:47.480
I'm just joking.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.520
Well, we aren't related by blood,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.280
but l feel like I'm a dad
about to marry off his daughter.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.520
I know.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.240
What is it?

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.160
Well, actually...

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.360
What's the matter?

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.680
Why didn't you attend
the residents' meeting?

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.080
What?

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.080
You asked us to
look for the murderer ourselves.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.680
Well...

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.760
I'm sorry. But l've already...

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.330
You told us the name you wrote
and the one on the piece of paper.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.570
Hey, you didn't tell them, did you?

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.900
Hey, it isn't something
that you can tell a random person!

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:45.940
Sorry.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.290
I'll tell you the name l wrote.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.770
It was Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.650
What? So...

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:55.850
Yes.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.890
Gosh, what is going on now?

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:02.080
I have joined them
to figure that out.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.640
So we're doing that, right?

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.680
Yes.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.400
We're looking for the person

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.800
who drew the paper
with "Kayo Kojima" written.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.620
Room 102's?

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.680
And the person who has Room 104's
Mrs lshizaki's piece of paper too.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:22.960
Hang on a second.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.200
If you want my help,
l can't do so now.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.480
The police suspect me.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.040
Because l have no alibi...

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.360
on the night that
Mr and Mrs Akaike were killed.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.000
Of course l didn't kill them.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.280
But there's a reason that
l can't tell them where l was.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.320
Let's start from the breakup scene
at the pub.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.440
But l haven't memorised
the lines of that scene.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.080
Will someone remind her
if she's at a loss for words?

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.360
You want a prompter? l'll do it.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.200
But you're new. Can you do it?

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.320
Let's begin and not waste any time.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.600
Huh?

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.560
Ready, start!

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.560
I think neither of us is at fault.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.200
We each have our own view
on what is right,

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.960
they just aren't compatible.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.440
If that's also what you think...

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.680
l want to break up with a smile.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.480
- No!
- "No."

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.720
"l don't want to! lf we'll break up
with a smile..."

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.120
- Wait...
- Yes?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.720
What are you doing?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.960
She didn't say her line,
so l prompted her.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.040
You just delayed a beat, right?

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.160
Yes, l did.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.480
I am sorry.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.580
I didn't expect you
to delay a beat here.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.360
If you don't mind, would you tell me
how you plan to act?

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.340
He said he wanted to break up
and l was hurt...

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.130
But looking at the development
of the whole story,

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:03.650
the girl totally expected
what the guy would say

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.010
when she is here, right?

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.730
So instead of being hurt
by what he says,

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.330
she would prevent him from saying...

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.010
- Please say the line.
- Yes?

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:14.500
The last line.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.460
What?

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.780
- Start here.
- Okay.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.220
If that's also what you think,
l want to--

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.210
No!

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.130
I think you should say it here.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.560
"I don't want to. lf we'll break up
with a smile,

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.460
l would be a lot happier if we hate
each other to the core!"

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.900
Then cue the music.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.940
It's a suggestion.
lt isn't absolute.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.180
There's no correct answer in acting.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.220
Let's do this again.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.360
Please let me learn from you.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.960
Okay!

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.700
Oh, I'm sorry. Please go ahead.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.820
You're poking your nose
into trouble like this, Ukita?

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.300
Please. This is for a girl
l love like my own daughter.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.460
I know where he is,

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.700
but won't you be in trouble
if the police sees you two meeting?

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.460
It was years ago. l'll be fine.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.760
Tell absolutely no one
that l told you where he is.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.680
Sure.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.010
"Brothel Paradise"

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.900
"Parking ticket"

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.700
Darn!

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.740
I should've parked it
at the carpark.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.900
"It is your turn to kill"

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.020
"lt is your turn to kill"

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.400
Good afternoon.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840
Good afternoon.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.160
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.680
- Sorry about the other day.
- Don't worry about it.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.160
I do want to help you,
but l am extremely busy.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.860
Sure. l understand.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.040
And one more thing.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.800
Yes?

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.960
I have information
that will help you,

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.680
that l refrained from telling you.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.560
Yes?

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.600
It's about Mr Kuzumi.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.400
I had bumped into him once
at the lift...

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.480
l thought it was fishy,

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.600
so l checked afterwards.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.080
It had been opened and closed
over and over again.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.310
Mr Kuzumi probably did this.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.200
You'd better not trust him too much.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.720
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.040
- It's okay.
- lt's okay.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.720
I didn't expect...

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.120
lt is messy, isn't it?

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.040
Yeah...

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.400
l've been busy going to school
and work.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.360
But you have financial support,
right?

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.160
Or you can't rent this flat
on your own.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.280
Well, my parents own this flat.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.560
- You made me jealous!
- You made me jealous!

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.520
- We said it together.
- Yeah.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.720
Well, l've made a summary of
Nana's notes here.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.600
This is...

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.400
l do maths in university,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.400
sometimes l can't write
all the calculations in my notebook.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.760
Wow...

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.560
Our main topic today...

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.200
is this.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:11.070
"Game participants,
name written, name drawn"

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.550
"Murderer? Victims"

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.550
"Residents not participating"

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:15.870
Amazing.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:20.430
I somehow feel that some people
don't like what we're doing,

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.150
so l think we'd better
talk here from now on.

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:25.270
You are right.

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.600
Somehow, l feel that
we can solve the problem.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.720
"Game participants 101: Kuzumi"

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.400
- Excuse me, Mr Kojima.
- What's the matter?

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.960
I forgot to tell you
that you have a parcel.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.920
Oh.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.640
It's bulky and heavy,
so it's at the distribution centre.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.480
It's fine. That's just my golf bag.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.200
"But your wife sent it here."

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.910
"Idiot, l don't want to see her,
that's why l made her send it here."

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:12.230
When l look at this,
everyone seems suspicious.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.870
Even people who didn't participate
in the game.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:19.320
Indeed. Like Room 501's Mr Sano.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.000
He lives right next to Mrs Akaike.

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.280
But he's been the same as always,
even after the murder.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.280
He always goes up the stairs
to the fifth floor.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.320
Yes. lsn't he scary?

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.160
Is Mrs Kojima all right?

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.600
I'm starting to get worried.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.200
"Staff entrance"

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.040
"Sender: Kayo Kojima"

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.640
Mr Kojima, you must be using
some fine quality clubs.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:00.360
- Yeah. You want to see?
- Of course.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.480
Mrs lshizaki too.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.550
Mrs lshizaki isn't on her own,
so I'm not worried yet.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:13.790
Yeah... Mrs Kojima's husband
hasn't been going home.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:16.760
This will surprise
a knowledgeable golf fan.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.370
But that happened to Mrs Akaike when
all three of them were together.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:26.450
Somehow I'm getting worried now.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.430
Should we go see Mrs Kojima?

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.420
Look!

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.740
Do you know how awesome they are?

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:49.230
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.390
Who drew my piece of paper?

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.910
We should tell the police.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.330
The people who threaten us
should be different,

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.490
but the handwriting is the same.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.610
"Getting close to the truth"
l think someone is lying.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:00.530
She was killed.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.610
You need a motive!

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:03.890
Nana... l hit the bull's eye!
