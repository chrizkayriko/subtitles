WEBVTT

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.950
On the first day we moved here,</i>

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.450
the residents played a murder-swap
game without me realising it.</i>

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.080
It's easier than doing surgery.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.330
During our investigation,</i>

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.720
we realised that murders not related
to the game could have happened...</i>

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.120
Nana!

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.880
But l didn't have time to be sad.</i>

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.920
What is this?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.960
Nana...

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.880
lt's the last time, please smile.</i>

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.280
You want to say something
to your husband, right?</i>

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.840
Shota.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.800
I...

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.440
There is something
that l have to do.</i>

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.680
I've brought the new resident here.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.280
I mainly do research on Al,
artificial intelligence.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.760
My wife was murdered,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.120
and l'd like you to
profile the murderer.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Hey!

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.420
You gave my flat's key
to Miss Kinoshita?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.250
It was Room 304's.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.290
My flat?

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.270
Miss Kinoshita lives
in Room 401, right?

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.350
What are they?

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.270
"Room 403, Fujii"

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.280
"Room 301, Ono, Room 302, Tezuka"

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.990
You're a bit too early.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.510
At this timing,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.710
you have already found me?

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.870
Wait, what is going on?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.030
The one who should tell us
what is going on isn't me, is it,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.910
murderer?

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.090
What are you talking about, Akane?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.150
Yomogida!

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.830
You're noisy.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.910
Come on, don't leave me out!

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.870
As you can see,

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510
l have checked everything here.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.390
What have you checked?

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.590
For what?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.190
To pursue the truth.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.790
By searching rubbish?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.430
Instead of what people say,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.710
they hide what they really think
in what they don't say.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.510
So, instead of what they treasure,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.550
a person's truth is in
the rubbish they throw away.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.110
By opening many bags of rubbish,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.400
l have found you...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.600
murderer.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Now, will the murderer be honest...

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.080
and raise their hand?

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.580
What?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.240
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.440
Did you hear someone else's voice?

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.840
It's a delicate period of time
for Sou!

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.500
Did you plot everything?

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.170
Mrs Akaike!

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.730
Mr Nikaido.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.810
I'm thinking about something.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.220
"Episode 12"

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.610
You're joking, right?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.890
Oh, it isn't me. Those...

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.610
"Akane Kinoshita"

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.970
Akane Kinoshita?

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.810
They're all about rubbish.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.820
Did you write all of them?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.400
You haven't been making sense to me.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.400
I wanted to see how you'd react

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.160
if l said l have checked everything,
so l said it on purpose.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.930
It didn't upset you at all.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.250
But you surprised me.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.450
I don't suspect you.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.770
Anyway...

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.410
it isn't okay to do this.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.250
I've published many stupid books,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.680
but still,
as a social nonfiction writer,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.520
l do this because l think revealing
the truth is my life's purpose.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.530
As you're here,
so l'll check with you.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.080
When the police talked to you
about Akaike's murder,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.840
l somehow heard them say
something like, "Oh, my..."

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.040
ls this the song?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.410
Julia!

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.930
Yes.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.210
Have you seen a long,
narrow CD like this?

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.490
We, especially Shota...

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.730
are very sad because
someone close to us was killed.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.690
You said it was your life's purpose,
but it's just for your books.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.730
I am sorry.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.610
Of course the people involved
would feel unpleasant,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.530
but from the real, dark cases,
if we can learn our lesson...

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.450
So have you got a clue
who the murderer is?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.650
This is embarrassing,
but not at all.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.600
Did you borrow Room 304's key
to look for the murderer?

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.020
Yeah, Ms Kitagawa moved away,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.140
I didn't think that
there would be any clues,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.460
but l wanted to check anyway.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.940
You entered Shota's flat too,
didn't you?

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.940
In other words, you're saying
that l killed his wife?

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.220
This isn't funny.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.220
Before you suspect someone,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.260
open 100 bags of the rubbish
they threw away.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.500
This is what <i>Rubbish Writer
Kinoshita</i> said.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.140
It's okay, Kuroshima. Let's go.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.100
No, it isn't okay.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.700
This flat is a treasure house
of data.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.720
Let's do some treasure hunting.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.600
Was this found in
Sanae Enomoto's flat?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Yes, sir. Yutaro Yamagiwa's DNA
was found on this bath towel.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.120
Was anyone else's DNA
found on this towel?

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.000
We found another person's DNA,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.680
but it isn't a match
with anyone in the Enomoto family.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.080
Oh?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160
What's the matter?

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.840
Nothing, it's just...

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.320
Kamiya.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.000
Kamiya!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.960
- Yes, sir?
- Explain.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.800
Regarding this case,
l have nothing more to add.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.960
Not this. Room 302's Nana Hosokawa?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.540
Wait, Hibino?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.300
We use Tezuka for convenience.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.980
I mean Nana Tezuka's call record.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.380
We still haven't found
Nana Tezuka's mobile,

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.300
but we've gotten the record.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.700
She talked to Mr Kamiya.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.300
She sought my advice on something.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.580
My husband has gone missing
since this morning.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.380
Is it related to the game?

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.860
She said she couldn't get hold
of Shota Tezuka...

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.870
lt's what you should've
reported first!

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.430
Sorry, sir.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.790
How long had Nana Tezuka been dead
when her body was found?

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.430
It was 29 to 31 hours
after her death.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.070
Give us your alibi
during that time, idiot.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.030
Yes, sir. Right away.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.070
Excuse me, sir,
l've got more to report.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.030
What?

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.050
The last call was made
to the nurses station.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.810
Well, her husband was hospitalised.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.970
Yes, but it was to
another hospital's nurses station.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.890
"Nurses Station"

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.370
What the heck?

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.610
That's scary.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.970
We'll borrow these.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.410
Give it back afterwards.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.730
We can't promise you
that we'll give it back.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.370
They aren't originally yours.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.810
I know, but...

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.210
Sorry. Thanks.
You have school, right?

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.250
- We'll finish the rest alone.
- But...

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.610
lt's okay.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.110
Okay.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.920
"Blender Housewife and
her husband's strange life"

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.920
Every single one of them...

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.700
This is my case.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.640
I have to go to school too.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.300
And l didn't sleep.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.980
"2nd April, at collection point
Yoko lshizaki"

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.630
Actually, at that time,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.270
l wrote my own name down.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.950
"Sachiko Akaike"

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.590
"Sachiko Akaike."

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.990
lt's the name on
the piece of paper l drew.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.750
"25th March,
201 Ukita's rubbish bag"

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.910
lnput this...

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.990
What are you doing?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:08:59.030
Nothing.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.830
Please input them.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.790
"Paper with Yoko lshizaki written
was thrown away on 2nd April"

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.030
This one too.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.150
"11th May, 501 Sano's rubbish bag"

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.150
But Sano didn't participate
in the game.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.590
Input it anyway.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.910
"Condolence Money Envelope"

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.310
"3rd May,
202 Kuroshima's rubbish bag"

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.630
Are you not going to defend me?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.430
Please tell me the truth,
so that l can defend you.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.750
When will l be released?

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.470
Damaging and abandoning
a dead body will be about 3 years.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.230
Sou will be 17 years old
three years later...

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.550
However, if you had also
committed murder...

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.630
How is Sou now?

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.990
You could be charged
for imprisoning Soichi...

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.990
No! l'm asking how his life is now!

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.830
Is Masako
looking after him properly?

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.390
- I think he's fine.
- l don't care what you think!

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.150
Things are now...

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.510
very delicate... for Sou now...

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.670
He's a teenager.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.710
So, about Yamagiwa's murder...

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.070
Yamagiwa doesn't matter at all!

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.630
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:33.550
It's okay.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.230
I only brought some stuff
for your parents,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.030
but they inspected my belongings
for some reason.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.790
Because you look funny.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.790
What?

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.630
Do you mean suspicious
or interesting?

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.190
If you mean interesting,
l'll forgive you!

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.230
Don't look so serious, teenager,
or l'll kiss you on the cheek.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.510
Let's go home.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.630
Hey!

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.580
Oh? Mrs Sachiko seems to be
in a good mood today.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.490
Yes, thank you.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.350
What's the matter?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.750
You want to watch it?

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.710
Wait a minute.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.030
There you go.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.150
- Thank you! Thank you!
- He always sings this.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.630
Thank you for this year too.
l sang my favourite song.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.910
Thank you-- ls he sleeping?

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.150
Okay, who requested...

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.070
He took my mic!

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.830
Oh, my Julia!

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.150
Mrs Akaike!

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.590
I feel guilty for coming every time
l want to deduce something.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.630
I don't mind, though.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.670
But l'll let you decide.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.750
In that case, l'll borrow it.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.110
Will you help me?

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.830
Why are you doing that again, Doyan?

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.190
Well...

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.190
please don't call me that.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.070
But you hate your first name, right?
So you're Doyan.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.600
Come on, please.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.400
We'll borrow this.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.560
Be careful.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.700
What's this?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.280
Well...

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.600
Could this be
the Fibonacci sequence?

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.360
Yes, l love it.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600
"Bochi" what?

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.900
- Fibonacci.
- Fibonacci.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.140
Oh. What's that?

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.380
Well...

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.590
lt's this.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.310
I can stare at
this equation forever.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.480
Yeah.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.620
I think you should explain it
with a diagram.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.030
First, the Fibonacci sequence

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.310
is like the
ammonite shell's structure...

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.990
lt's all right.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.830
You science people
can get excited about it.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.870
Doyan, what do people call you?

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.310
Just Nikaido.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.230
What? lt's so boring.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.140
Thank you for this morning.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.740
Please tell me if you remember
anything else.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.620
It's okay, don't bother.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.550
"Xinyi, Misato and Goro Akaike"

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.510
We can't hide anymore!

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.470
What's the matter?

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.510
Those guys have investigated a lot.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.910
It's a matter of time
that they find out!

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.310
What are you talking about?

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.590
Mr Tezuka and his friends

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.170
wrote things about the game
on the whiteboard,

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.290
and it says l killed
Mr and Mrs Akaike!

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.290
That's...

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.130
They guessed wrong.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.890
Yeah, they guessed wrong, but...

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:48.810
lt's okay, then.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.130
But if they have dug so deep,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.840
they'll find out about you
and our friends' visa!

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.840
Mr Tamiya...

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.240
Nana...

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.120
And Mrs lshizaki too.

"Yoko lshizaki"

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120
Really?

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.960
See? That means
Mrs lshizaki didn't lie.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.800
Of course, it isn't
entirely impossible that

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.680
someone made a fake one
and threw it away.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.400
And Mr Ukita didn't lie either.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.000
Also...

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.810
After what happened,

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.370
we can be sure about this too.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.570
"Yutaro Yamagiwa"

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.170
"Sanae Enomoto:
Paper drawn: Yutaro Yamagiwa"

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.890
Looking at this,
we haven't made much progress.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.990
No.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:14.290
Also, Miss Kinoshita took this too.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.770
Kuroshima, she got it from
a bag of your rubbish.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.770
Do you remember this?

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.530
I...

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.890
Will you answer me right away?

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.250
If you think too long, l'd think
that you're concocting a lie.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.770
Sure.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.170
My last boyfriend passed away.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.010
What?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.290
I used it for his funeral.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.320
I think you met him once.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.290
- Where's the convenience store?
- l don't know.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.890
Go to the main road and turn right.
lt's just 100 metres away.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.010
He got drunk
and had a fight with a stranger,

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.930
and suddenly...

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.290
Sorry, l had no idea.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.150
It's okay.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.890
He wasn't a nice person.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.930
He appeared to be very normal,

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.410
but he was very violent.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.610
I was often physically abused too,

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.410
so l could accept that he died
after a fight.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.250
Of course, l was sad that he died,
and l was surprised too,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.880
but when l was freed
from my boyfriend...

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.370
l felt a bit relieved too.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.840
People around me said
l became more cheerful.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.080
She kept shouting
"minced meat cutlet" very loudly.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.470
You talk a lot today.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.070
It's awful to say l became cheerful
because someone died, but...

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:58.550
l think l am more awful.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.480
After listening to what you said,
l still suspect you.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.800
If your boyfriend abused you,
did you actually write his name?

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.150
No, l...

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.800
Does this person really exist?

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.470
Yes, he does.
l think l had mentioned it before...

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.380
We are on very bad terms,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.340
and he said he'd definitely
make me repeat.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.240
Make you repeat?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.440
Yes. Why?

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.440
Maths Department's Hayakawa?

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.000
You study at lnternational Science
and Engineering University too?

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.880
Yeah, but l am
a postgrad student now.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.040
Wow, you are my senior!

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.880
That professor hates
all the students.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.280
Yes. l don't want to
talk behind his back, but...

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.560
But you wrote him as
the person you want to kill.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.520
"Kuroshima, Professor Hayakawa"

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.800
l did.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.480
I am sorry!

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.280
It's the second time l suspect you
for something l shouldn't.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.120
I'm sorry.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.140
Kuroshima, you have helped me
so much, but l...

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.020
l am so horrible!

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.580
It's okay. Please don't say that.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.820
Sorry.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.240
Mr Tamiya!

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.600
Oh?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160
Miss Higashi?

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.380
What?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.540
You're my junior in the drama group,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.100
but you are experienced in life
and l think l can count on you.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.980
There are other people
l can count on,

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.020
but when l was pondering
why l kept thinking about you...

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.220
l realised...

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.760
that it was love.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.990
In other words, at the critical time,
before our actual performance,

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.710
you propose to have
an affair with me?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.670
That isn't my intention.
Please forget it if it is unwanted.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.590
I am a man who has only
dated his wife.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.630
I've been austere in my life, so...

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.750
l am so sorry!

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:21.230
So when a young lady like you
says that to me...

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.670
l give up easily!

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.310
Yes?

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.550
Oh, no!

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.950
What?

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.650
Your hand is soft.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.820
I shouldn't!

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.470
No!

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.910
I am sorry!

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.120
I know l shouldn't
say this now either,

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.610
but a short while ago, you said...

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.370
l have no time left!

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:01.370
What do you mean?

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:06.730
I thought maybe you had a disease,
so l had to tell you.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.430
Mr Tamiya,

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.240
please spend
the rest of your life with me!

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.520
It is true that l have no time left,
but l don't have a disease.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.780
There is something
that l haven't done.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.150
What is it? Please tell me!

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.430
Live a pure and right life
is my motto.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.150
However, if l want to be right...

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.990
sometimes l cannot stay pure.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.710
That's what l really think.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.070
Sorry, l didn't answer
your question.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.930
At least...

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.320
l want to make sure
that l was right.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.140
I...

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.590
What am l doing?

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.960
I'll get that much?

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.240
Will you also come on weekends?

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.950
Yes, you can count on me.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.110
Will meals be provided?

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.950
You can choose from the menu,
but they don't taste good.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.150
Manager! Have pride in your job.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:09.470
Customers come to enjoy the
nostalgic atmosphere not the food.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.630
"Stand-up meal, school meal"

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.370
Well, l need money, but even so...

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.410
Manager!
Have you got other outfits?

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.890
I'll pay you a lot,
so put up with it.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.970
Mr Ukita's follower number two!

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.210
- What?
- What?

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.380
Excuse me...

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:32.120
l hope you would let me
wear something else if possible.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.680
But it suits you. Or you can wear
the same outfit as Kakinuma's.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.340
Say that before l wear it, jerk!

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.980
Oh! Number one too.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.220
What?

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.940
I asked you to talk politely
at the restaurant, didn't l?

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.020
Endure it!
He is going to pay us a lot, right?

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.900
I'm looking forward to it, Manager.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.180
- She's cute.
- She's cute.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.620
That got on my nerves!

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.740
It seems that he runs
other restaurants too,

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.340
we'll use him well.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.020
Somehow that guy creeps me out.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.460
He suddenly started hiring
the residents.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.700
We haven't got a job
after Mr Ukita passed away,

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.060
and we have to pay
the out-of-court settlement too.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.330
Before we take revenge for Mr Ukita,

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.010
- we should make a living...
- Shut up. l know.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.710
So, follower number two.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.470
- I am Kakinuma!
- Kaki...

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:30.110
And why am l number two?

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.030
- Well, you aren't wrong though!
- Right?

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.960
She is wrong!

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.320
We'll sell something else at
that shop at the end of August.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.480
Idiot, nobody drinks Bubble tea
in autumn.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.960
Now is the time to withdraw.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.610
Ouch!

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:07.210
Drive off the dodgy guy!

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.260
Ow...

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.170
Ow... Wait, it's me!

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.330
It's me!

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.470
What?

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.290
I am sorry!

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.990
But what have you been doing?

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.310
What? This is my home.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.510
It's the first time
l see that look on your face.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.070
I decided to sell this flat
after all this,

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.110
but l can't find anyone to buy it.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.830
It's a murderers' condo.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.710
I can't stay where l've been
staying forever either.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.360
You were kicked out of
your lover's home.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.360
Anyway, l will live here
starting today.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.600
I absolutely refuse!

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.640
What?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:58.760
You're suspected for dismembering
Kayo with your lover!

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.470
I am not suspected.
Go and ask the police.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.070
I suspect you!

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.550
The husband is back.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.870
Husband?

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.790
Mr Kojima!

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.670
He'll stay at that flat again.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.310
Is he okay?
Has he gotten over his wife's death?

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.630
Why don't you stop worrying
about other people

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.310
and worry about me?

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.030
I worry about you.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.750
But you're playing!
Your guitar is noisy.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:33.190
How can you be so calm?

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.510
I can't stay calm,
that's why l do this.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.150
Don't tell me...

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.190
Was it you?

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:44.350
What do you mean?

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.630
Did you...

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.830
Did you plot everything?

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.390
- Wait, what are you talking about?
- Don't get near me!

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.840
Bon appetit.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.600
So good!

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.450
I think l've told you that
l don't like it.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:23.010
Yes.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.790
But you have to eat properly,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.950
because your body
isn't only yours now.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.110
I'll be fine.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.550
What...

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.270
l'm not joking.
l'll cook for you every day.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:53.830
Every day, until the person
who murdered Nana is arrested.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.110
If you don't like this,
finish making the Al quickly.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.110
Thank you.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.550
I'm sorry, but the data l've got
is insufficient.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.990
If you've kept the texts
and photos you took with Nana,

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.590
will you show me all of them?

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:32.520
Sure. Please wait a moment.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:39.470
"Room deodoriser"

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.960
What are you doing?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.800
You'd better tidy up your room.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.000
How did you come in?

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.680
Your door wasn't locked.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.200
If your room is messy,
it makes your mind messy...

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.680
Ow...

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.310
Don't do anything
that makes me suspect you!

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.460
What?

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.500
If l assume that
you are the murderer,

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.470
what do you think l'll do?

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.360
Before l turn you to the police,
l'll push you down the balcony.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.040
No, you won't.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.080
I am serious.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.720
I start to think that l can't search
who murdered Nana one by one anyway.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.320
So l'll kill all the residents here.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.960
The murderer must be among you.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.600
That means l'll have taken
my revenge.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.160
That's what l think.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.440
Even l am scared of myself.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.680
I am sorry.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.610
He's scary.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.630
He is scary.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.590
He is scary.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.440
Don't say you can't!

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.800
Okay, all right!

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.440
Yes!

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.530
Please marry me.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.510
Yes.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.430
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.250
Why did you lie?

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.370
Oh, it's hot!

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.730
It's surprisingly tasty!

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.490
Yes!

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.370
We'll change many times,

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:58.410
we'll love each other
after we change,

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.610
and let's fall in love with
each other again and again.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.280
Excuse me.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.800
The pot is getting cold.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.610
Look.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.730
Nana is smiling in all the photos.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:43.980
Both of you are smiling.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.660
Well, l'm aware that those people
have been fishing for information.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.900
They've been here many times.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.980
So, what are you here for?

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.580
I see.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.540
You went down from there?

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.700
"Fire ladder"

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.180
Room 303 is empty,

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.700
and l thought scaring you as much as
possible would be effective.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.820
But you killed the owner yourself.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.660
Why did you get us involved?

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.140
At that time,

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.980
l thought everyone would shut up
if there were more accomplices.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.780
But the matter
has gotten too serious now.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.740
What? Are you here to blame me?

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.300
We aren't.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.420
We're here to apologise.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.660
What?

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.380
I hacked into the computer
at your workplace.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:00.980
"Murderer"

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.580
l knew you did it!

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.060
It was because
you kept threatening us.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:09.420
You realised that
l overstayed my visa,

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.250
then you threatened us again.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.060
"It's your turn to kill,
or you'll be deported!"

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.010
"lt's your turn to kill

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.250
or you'll be deported!"

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:19.850
That's... Hang on.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.170
It doesn't benefit me
if l talk so much.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.810
I want to be with Cuong forever.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:26.930
What?

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.530
You too, lqbal! l want to stay with
our friends at home.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.450
Yeah?

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.890
So l want to work with you
and hide this.

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:42.780
But you still haven't told me
what you want to hide.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:54.060
We killed Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.260
"Yoshihiko Hakamada"

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.100
That's what l thought.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.220
We regret it.
We shouldn't have done this.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.890
To make up for it at least a bit,

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.220
- we watched all Hakamada's films.
- All?

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.180
"A Touch of Fever" was amazing.
Will you watch it, Fujii?

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.660
Yeah, l will...

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.330
but how did you kill him?

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.980
Iqbal hacked into the computer
at Hakamada's agency.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:22.900
It's hacking again?

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.020
So we got his work schedule

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.340
and looked for a place
to attack him.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.460
Iqbal said
that was the only place...

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.100
Ouch!

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.500
Cut it out!

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.500
Hey, handsome,

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:42.220
do you think l'd do anything
just because you're handsome?

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.810
I tell you...

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.090
l am not going to help you do that!

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:56.860
"Try Up Gym"

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.410
Oh? Mr Tezuka.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.570
Good morning.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.420
I haven't seen you in a while.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.580
Yes, l was on holiday.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.070
Starting today,
l will be working again.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.870
Are you okay now?

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.350
I am not okay,

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.120
but l can pretend to be okay!

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.160
Well, someone asked you to be her
personal trainer, what do you say?

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.760
I'll do it.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.940
- The lady is waiting over there.
- Okay.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.420
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.820
Nice to meet you.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.140
Nice to meet you.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.260
I am Tezuka.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.260
Oops.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.810
"International Science
and Engineering University"

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:15.700
Mr Nikaido.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.220
You really are my senior.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.660
It's a wonder that
we've never met before.

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.420
Even if we had,
l had no idea who you were.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.140
Hello?

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.140
Oh?

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.020
Oh, l'm sorry.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.890
I was thinking about something.

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.620
About Shota?

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.900
No...

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.580
May l?

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.980
Wait!

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.740
What's the matter?

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.020
Sorry, l have to do a presentation.

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.340
Soichi?

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.140
Sawa!

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:42.740
A cat?

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.140
Is that...

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.020
He doesn't move.
Do you know where the hospital is?

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.060
But l think he's dead.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.020
Don't cry.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.620
Well...

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.860
Let's bury him somewhere.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.580
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.660
Let's go.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.030
You shouldn't take him around
at such a late hour.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:35.510
I am very sorry.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:36.670
But auntie...

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:37.750
Oh? Soichi?

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.790
I heard you were staying at
an orphanage!

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.990
I am sorry.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:46.110
I thought you knew.
He has started going to school.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:49.200
I didn't... What a surprise!

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.180
You were in the room
with him, weren't you?

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.820
Yes.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.260
I am sorry,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.620
l didn't want him to see
anyone involved in the case,

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.740
so l didn't let him
go and say hello.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.740
Okay.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.140
I am sorry.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.940
You are fine, because you're cute.

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.270
But l would like to ask
you something.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.510
Not about the case.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.470
Okay.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.590
- When we were imprisoned,
- l said no!

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.870
Did you hear another person's voice
besides your dad's and your mum's?

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.950
I make my decisions quickly.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.110
I don't really know.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.630
- I see.
- That's enough!

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:35.250
Let's stop here.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:45.050
There was definitely
a third person's voice.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.770
I told the police too.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.220
Oh, it's Doyan.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.700
What will we have
for supper tonight?

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.420
Hello.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.660
May l talk to you for a bit?

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.620
See? l knew it!

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.260
What do you know?

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.560
All these towels belong to
the Enomoto family, right?

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.240
Have you realised something?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.160
No.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.340
They are all camel!

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.280
Indeed, they are all beige.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.840
Indeed, they are beige.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.160
What about beige?

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.520
You call it beige too.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.250
And this is the bath towel that
we found Yamagiwa's DNA on.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.170
It's purple?

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.530
This towel doesn't belong to
the Enomoto family, does it?

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:41.850
I see.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.650
If we dig further along that line,

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:48.170
maybe we will find out
who the other DNA belongs to.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.490
I've got something
that might cause a stir.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:51.410
What is it?

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.010
It isn't related to our case,

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.650
but the suspects of the murder of
Yoshihiko Hakamada were narrowed down

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.370
and they've searched
all over the country.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.290
They seem gentle though.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.130
"Profiling Results"

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.130
What do you mean?

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:10.410
For example, most of
the Japanese people are this tall,

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.650
which means we don't know anything.

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.770
Why do you show me this?

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.370
I just want to.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.200
You seem to expect too much from Al,

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.920
so l should tell you how little
the data we now have can do.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.480
What about "committed by
the same murderer" here?

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:30.890
It's the probability that

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.810
Nana and the other victims here were
killed by the same person.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:39.010
But l have too little data about
this too and l can't say anything.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.090
Did the data about
Ono and Fujii help?

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.570
Somehow you look scary.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.690
We found that
the chemical used to kill her

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.050
was pharmaceutical
potassium chloride.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:52.290
Well, l doubt it.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.450
Especially in Dr Fujii's case...

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.450
What?

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.210
Potassium chloride
was what killed her.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.650
If we let the Al analyse it
when we have so few samples,

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.010
it'll say Fujii is the murderer.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.820
I thought Fujii was suspicious too.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.180
It is a chemical that
a doctor can easily get.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.920
We use the Al to avoid
simple guesses like this.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.780
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.060
Okay.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.260
Good night.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.860
I have to eliminate
the possibility one by one.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:40.300
Right, Nana?

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.820
You come here every day.
This isn't right.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.460
Wait...

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.060
Hey... What are you doing?

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.060
What are you doing?

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.700
Looking for evidence.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.900
That's trespassing!

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:05.700
It is. Please call the police.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.940
I will!

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.820
I'll call the police!
They'll be here at once!

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.500
You'll be in trouble!

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:16.560
Then, l'll say to them,
"This guy killed Nana!"

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.000
The police will search your flat.
Are you okay with that?

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.520
With what?

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.440
Will you really be okay
even if they search your flat?

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.800
Yeah, l will.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.240
You talk like a child when you lie.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.400
Hey! Wait... No! Hang on...

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.340
Oh?

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.420
Oh, gosh! lt isn't my fault, okay?

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.140
We've got some breaking news.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.340
This May,

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.500
Actor Yoshihiko Hakamada was killed
in a mountain in Tochigi Prefecture,

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.380
and photos of the murder suspects
have been released.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.780
The wanted men are
an Iranian man Ali Moharrami

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.720
and an American...

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:30.570
This is Kuroshima.

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:32.610
Shota, can you watch the TV now?

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.640
Please call back
when you hear my message.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.500
Stop it.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.500
No...

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.300
lt's getting more and more serious

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.020
and l don't know
what they're saying.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.940
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.900
l am Minami and
l've moved to Room 502.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.380
What a nuisance.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.740
He had a smile on his face.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.700
In details!

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.820
I'll say everything.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:57.900
I beat him with a hammer.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.660
When will this stop?

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.380
About Miss Kuroshima.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.860
She is strange.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.860
Why?
