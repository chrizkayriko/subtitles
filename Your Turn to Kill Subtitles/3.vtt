Everyone must have someone
whom they want to kill.</i>

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.270
l think what he said started it.</i>

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.880
We wrote the names of the people
we want to kill as a kind of joke,</i>

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.640
and showed each other secretly.</i>

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.440
Takafumi Kono</i>

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.970
But maybe, someone
didn't think that it was joke.</i>

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.790
Do you suspect me?
l'll tell you now,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.170
the name l wrote
was Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.570
Mr Fujii, look!

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.360
The unidentified body found
in a mountain in Kanagawa Prefecture

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.140
was Dr Yutaro Yamagiwa,
commonly known as Dr Yamagiwa...

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.300
Several unbelievable incidents
happened right under my nose.</i>

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.830
It wasn't me...

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.390
They couldn't find his head.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.070
Even at somewhere l don't know...</i>

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.110
Something started to happen.</i>

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.220
Hair...

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.550
Why?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.590
You startled me.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.070
Mr Fujii, are you okay?

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.790
Somehow your face looks
even weirder than usual.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.820
No, l...

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.310
Could you have found
Dr Yamagiwa's head in your flat?

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.590
Yes, l did.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.630
No, l didn't! lt isn't in my flat!

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.870
How can it be?

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.780
My flat is totally empty!

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.060
Anyway, what's wrong?

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.550
Let's say, in the unlikely case
that the head is there,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.390
if it is so obvious,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.940
then the murderer can't be me,
right?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.340
You must be the murderer, then.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.420
You don't normally have
someone's head.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390
Gosh!

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.150
Yutaro Yamagiwa</i>

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.380

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.900

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.030

Episode 3

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.990
Will you throw away the rubbish,
please?

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.350
Yeah, sure.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.110
You know, Yutaro Yamagiwa
didn't just have his head removed,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.710
it seems that his fingerprints
were burned too.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.230
Not interested.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.270
Orangutan Time.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.310
Shota?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.150
It appears that the murderer
hid the dead body's identity

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.830
to delay the process
of the investigation.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.270
In other words,
the murder was planned.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.350
You'll be late.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.470
The murderer bore a deep grudge,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.710
and swore to kill him one day.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.230
They had imagined how to kill
Yamagiwa and deceive the police

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.310
when the time comes.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.790
How is my suspicion?
ls it a bull's-eye?

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.470
Stop thinking about that
and go to work now.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.510
But you've been thinking a lot
lately too.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.590
And you're absent minded.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.630
What? Why do you think so?

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.670
Because that's my toothbrush.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.550
What?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.790
Why? Do you think it's gross?

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.430
- No, l...
- Do you not love me?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.670
I do, but using another person's
toothbrush is...

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.390
But l can use yours.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.310
- Don't use it!
- Just occasionally.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.470
No, loving someone and this,
are different matters.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.030
To me, loving someone is being able
to use the same toothbrush.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.550
What?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.870
I've actually used yours many times.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.390
You lied.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.390
You know?
But you look so depressed!

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.750
The property manager
suddenly died and l...

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.070
l'm sorry that giving you a hug
is all l can do.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.470
It's okay. Thank you.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.150
You don't look okay, so l'll hug you
for ten more seconds.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.470
Whose stomach just rumbled?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.790
I don't know.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.550
You don't know, right?

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.070
I want to stay so close to you that
l can't tell whose stomach rumbles.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.650
I won't hide anything from you.
l swear.

Oh, it's you, Miss Kinoshita?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.720
Just now...

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.240
Did you say
"Whoa, chai, chai, chai?"

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.680
l was startled. l couldn't help...

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.520
What does
"Whoa, chai, chai, chai" mean?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.040
It doesn't mean anything.
l shouted because you startled me.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.000
I startled you,
so you carelessly cursed me?

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.040
I didn't curse you!
What are you doing anyway?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.800
I was made to clean
the rubbish collection area.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.550
Did you sort it properly?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.150
I'll curse you if you didn't.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.710
I did!

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.300
- Hello.
- Good morning.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.540
Which floor?

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.140
You won't get off?

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.700
Oh, yes, l will.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.620
- Hang on.
- Yes?

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.620
Will you be available tonight?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.850
Yes.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.010
Sora, do you have to go
to nursery school?

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.930
What about the live programme?

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.650
We can't do it without a guest.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.730
Yes.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.570
- Hey...
- What?

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.690
If you want to say something,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.490
say it when the kid isn't here.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.530
If you shout at his mother
in front of him, it'll hurt him too.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.170
Okay. Yes, you can bring that.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.090
Hurry up! Or l'll beat you up!

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.690
Come on, he'll beat you up.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.570
I'll take it...

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.010
l'll also...

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.130
Yes, someone might be able to come.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.370
You two are always so close.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:19.770
Not exactly, l just always
rely on her to look after me.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.970
- That's not the case.
- Right.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.450
No need to be modest.
You really help me a lot.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.530
Oh, by the way, Misato,
show the lady that.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.450
- "That"?
- Yes, you know...

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.410
What l asked you to keep for me.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.050
Okay!

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.570
You know what she refers to just by
that? You two are really close!

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.050
Mum!

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.330
Oh, no!

- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.170
- I'm okay...
- Please forgive me!

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.290
- Sachiko...
- l'm sorry.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.130
I'm so sorry...

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.290
You don't have to tell Goro,

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.970
or he will be angry at you that you
forgot to lock the wheelchair.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.250
Okay.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.530
How kind of you to cover it up
for your daughter-in-law!

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.850
I should learn from you.

Dr Fujii?

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.690
Will you tell me when you come in?
What's the matter?

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.120
What else? l'm here to work.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.120
Of course. l am sorry.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.760
You haven't been yourself lately.
l am worried.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.880
Sorry. Thank you.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.880
You see, your reputation is very bad
among the patients and nurses,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.080
so l am worried
that you will be fired soon.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.160
What?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.720
I'm saying that if l complain
about you,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.200
even if it's something trivial,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.880
you'll be fired at once.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.200
That's how much your job is at risk.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.280
Is that so?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.960
Yes, it is.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.400
So don't you dare
cause me any problems, Fujii!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.920
- Answer me!
- Yes!

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.320
I look forward to working with you
today too.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.290
What do you think about Mr Fujii?

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.930
What do you mean?

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.910
I mean, Mr Fujii...

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.290
Someone said
that maybe he killed Dr Yamagiwa.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.210
Who said that?

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.350
Almost everyone.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.090
I don't think he did.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.250
At that time, Mr Fujii...

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.150
The unidentified dead body has been
found to be Dr Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.550
It wasn't me...

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.520
He was shocked and it seems
that he really had no idea.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.230
Yeah...

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.880
He couldn't have killed the doctor.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.480
The deaths of the property manager
and Yutaro Yamagiwa...

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.800
have nothing to do
with the game, right?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.270
Do you find anyone
among the residents suspicious?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.200
I don't want them dead, but there
is someone l hope will disappear.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.440
The person l want to kill
and l don't know everyone.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.880
I wanted him to die once,
come back to life, then die again.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.760
Why don't we reveal it together?

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.640
Do not show anyone else.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.760
Now, open it!

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:20.950
I don't.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.110
I think.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.640
Kojima Kids' English Class</i>

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.480
Thank you for teaching me.
See you...

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.080
See you next week.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.760
Has everyone got biscuits?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.120
- Come to my home!
- Let's go!

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.120
Let's go home.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.080
Fumi.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.120
Kazu, you haven't been coming
to my lessons lately,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.600
what's the matter?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.040
We had a cold.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.840
Mummy told us to say
that we had a cold.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.720
Gosh!

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.520
I am home.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.640
"I'll attend the urgent
residents' meeting. Nana."

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.120
My point is,
the rumour is groundless,

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.400
let's not hurt Mr Fujii's feelings
because of that.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.200
And my point is,

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.400
don't call us to meet
just for something like that!

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.400
It isn't trivial.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.520
You have no right
to summon us to a meeting.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.120
I do. lt is written on the contract
we signed when we moved in.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.520
If something makes
the residents suffer any harm...

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.560
- You know...
- Yes?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.880
I love seeing middle-aged men
getting desperate.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.130
The contract is about water leakage!

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.850
The person concerned, Mr Fujii,
is absent in the first place.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.370
Everyone, calm down.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.850
Our property manager
and Yutaro Yamagiwa died,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.770
it's made all of us worried.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.370
Why are you worried?

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.850
Because they could've been
killed by someone.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:11.210
Why? Mrs lshizaki, do you think
someone among us killed them?

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.700
No! l just...

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.110
Because some people are absent
from the meeting today.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.290
I don't want to get suspicious
like this!

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.090
Please be careful of what you say!

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.490
You are being too serious as usual.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.850
Hang on.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.070
Mr Ukita, you always say
that l am a serious person,

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.270
but l am not that serious!

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.550
I may not look it,

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.060
but l joined a theatre group called
Humour Estate when l was young.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.860
Like The Third Stage in the East,
Sotobakomachi in the West,

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.140
Minami Banzai lchiza

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.860
and Gekidan Shinkansen,
it was full of humour...

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.460
That's why l say you're serious!

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.300
Everyone.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.020
I don't suspect anyone of you,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.860
but Mr Fujii has been
receiving threatening notes.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.100
Threatening notes?

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.380
Yes.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.380
Lately, l find these every day
when l go home.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:11.980
This one too.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.980
Murder lnducement</i>

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.830
What is this? Murder...

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.810
lt is murder inducement.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:28.000
A person who induces another
to commit a crime

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.960
shall be dealt with in
sentencing as a principal.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.220
ln other words...

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.020
lnducement.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.220
It means incite, right?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.020
Even if you didn't carry it out,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.900
if you incite or urge someone
to murder,

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.900
you'll be punished,
like the murderer.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.260
You know a lot!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.860
You copied those?

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.300
I didn't. lt's mentioned
in detective stories occasionally.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.980
Who sent them to Mr Fujii and why?

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.860
If they were sent by the person
who killed Yutaro Yamagiwa,

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.150
l think they mean,
he is just as guilty as they are.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.730
This is absurd.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.530
If you say that, everyone
who participated in the game

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.110
induced someone
to commit murder.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.550
Why do you have this conclusion?

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.630
If writing who we want to kill
makes us guilty,

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:20.910
then we're all guilty.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.730
But l just wrote a name!

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.890
I was forced to participate.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.490
That's why l said it was absurd.

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.730
But that's what the law is.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.690
Even though you had no idea
and had no such intention,

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.890
it is still a crime
and you will be arrested.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.770
But it's quite funny
if we'll all be arrested.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.090
It isn't funny.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.110
In the end,
who sent them to Mr Fujii?

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.310
Someone among us.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.100
Stop looking at each other
with suspicion.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:04.180
First of all, everybody here
didn't kill Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.540
That means it was someone
who is absent today?

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.860
For example, the Chinese girl,

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.820
or the workaholic woman,

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.740
or the S&amp;M university student.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.420
S&amp;M university student?

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.700
You know, the girl in Room 202.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.820
She always has bandage
on a part of her body.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.380
Is that what it is?

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.460
It's obvious.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.940
The same thing turns me on.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.660
Don't get the wrong idea.
l am an extreme masochist.

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.660
What did we get wrong?

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.300
This isn't a place for you to
talk about something so dirty!

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.290
You had never fought with anyone
even when you worked at the back.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.170
l didn't have a fight.
l only slammed the table.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.130
What?

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.310
Go and find something new

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.740
to be enthusiastic about,
like when you used to have a job!

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.650
Don't say it like l'm an old man
retired from the world.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.730
Recruiting theatre group members</i>

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.850
Since we became friends,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.430
we've only been talking
about murderers and victims,

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:24.930
and it's awful.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.770
I want to hear you brag
about your new married life.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.020
There is nothing
worth talking about.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.290
You look like you do.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.860
- Hello.
- Are you all right?

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.230
I am all right.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.710
- I think we shouldn't ask.
- Why?

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.870
You're joking. Really? ls it true?

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.070
So in the end,
what did you talk about?

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.230
- What do you mean?
- The residents' meeting.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.950
Why did you have an urgent meeting?

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.470
Well...

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.850
Are you going to lie?

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.260
Nana, you have a habit
to bite your lip when you lie.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.140
Why do you lie?

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.780
You lied about me biting my lip,
didn't you?

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.580
How do you know?

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.660
You always scratch
your right chest when you lie.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.260
Actually, l have used it many times.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.900
Nana, you have a habit
to bite your lip when you lie.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.420
Really?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.500
What? l'm not aware of it at all!

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.260
- You often do it.
- What?

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.140
So, what is it, then?

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.700
Well, Room 103's Mr Tamiya

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.860
said that residents haven't been
sorting their rubbish properly,

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.740
so he told us to pay attention.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.700
A lady got angry at me for that
in the rubbish collection area too.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.340
She's probably in charge
of cleaning the area...

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.940
Miss Kinoshita, right?

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.460
- How do you know?
- Because we talked for a bit.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.900
She is single,

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.350
and she said she liked
watching musicals.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.990
You really get along
with everyone right away.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.110
What? That's not true.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:14.900
Yes, it is true.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.300
Is that so?

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.390
No, not get along quickly,
you get too familiar right away.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.610
You dissed me a bit, didn't you?

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:23.690
No, l didn't.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.210
Sho, l am saying that this
is what people like about you.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.330
Okay.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.150
- You speak too loudly.
- No, it's you.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.190
Sorry, we'll be more careful.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.830
Okay...

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.670
How about doing 50 more times?

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.110
You're a demon!

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.430
Okay, one.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.220
Two.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.700
- That's enough!
- Yes?

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.510
- Good bye!
- Wait!

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.030
Yes?

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:06.870
What's the matter?

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:09.790
It's your turn to kill</i>

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.780
Write this.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.300
Write what?

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.700
Write "It is your turn to kill."

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.700
- Now.
- Okay.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.740
It is your turn to kill</i>

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.870
lt's different?

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:39.830
What's wrong, Mr Fujii?

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.470
What the heck?
l can't stand it anymore!

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.230
- Mr Fujii?
- l hate this.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.860
Do l have to go
to every single flat?

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.030
Everyone is going to think
l'm a weirdo!

00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:00.070
Everyone is going to think
l'm a weirdo!

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.070
Are you okay?

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.230
I am not okay!

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.990
Obviously something is wrong
with me now!

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.290
Just calm down.
Let's talk about it inside.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:09.730
Are you sure?

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.430
Well, let's talk here first.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.340
- You don't want to?
- l...

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.000
You don't want a weird guy
in your flat?

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.580
No, that's not what l mean.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.180
Kuzumi...

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.620
Do you know a Masao Tanaka?

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.100
Who?

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.700
Forget it if you don't.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.060
Bhutanese Cuisine, Dorj's Diner</i>

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.780
This is delicious.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.810
Don't worry.
l guarantee that it's delicious.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.740
- It's hot!
- But delicious, right?

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.340
Come on, give him some.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.500
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.170
Who is this?

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.880
It's better to have a big bite.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:56.530
What's the matter, Dorj?

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.650
What will you do
on our next regular day off?

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.010
Go to school.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.410
I see. I'm impressed
by how hard-working you are.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.850
By the way,
have you fixed your DVD player?

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.260
Why don't you come
and watch at my place?

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.260
I couldn't fix it,
so l bought a Blu-ray player.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.260
I spent a lot!

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.220
I bought a cushion too!
An expensive one.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.260
Why don't you come
and feel it at my place?

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.460
I've got a cushion at home too.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.080
Come on, just come and feel it once.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.400
You can come anytime.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.760
I'll give you my spare key.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.800
No, thanks!

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.760
But don't bring the friends
who share the flat with you along.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.240
Excuse me, do you mind
if l ask your name?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.080
Yes?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:54.350
If you are Mr Masao Tanaka,
l might kill you.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.510
What is your name?

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.030
- Tell me your name.
- What did you say?

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.890
Mr Fujii!

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.560
Mr Fujii!

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.050
I'm home!

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.010
Sorry, l went to have dinner
with Sanae.</i>

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.500
I wondered if they knew him,
so l asked.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:23.670
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.790
Even if they do,

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:27.110
what were you going to do?

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:28.740
What will l do?

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.430
Someone hates this Tanaka so much
that they want to kill him,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.740
so l want to see what he looks like.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.180
Is that all?

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.260
Of course.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.340
Xinyi, do you know a Masao Tanaka?

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.620
I have no Japanese friend.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.010
The way you say that is cute.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.450
You're Chinese, why do you work
at a Bhutanese restaurant?

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.580
There are Japanese people
working at Italian restaurants too!

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.610
She's not cute at all.

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:00.730
What did you say?

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:05.330
You're not thinking that you have
to kill someone this time, are you?

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.740
Of course not!

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:12.090
We heard that you've been threatened
and we are worried.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.060
It wasn't you guys, right?

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.620
Of course not.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.380
The murderer who killed Yamagiwa
has to be one of the residents.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.930
Why do you think so?

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.220
I don't trust anyone of you too.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.740
I don't want to say it.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.900
Good morning.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.260
Did you buy those?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.820
There are various types nowadays.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.130
Why did you buy so many?

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.620
Do l need to explain?

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.580
Yes, if possible.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.130
To make the world better.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.810
You didn't explain anything.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.570
There is an air of unrest
in the residential tower,

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.790
it has been causing suspicion
and fear in the residents.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.970
I can't let it pass.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.370
Even so, why do you have to do this?

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.580
If it doesn't need me to do it,
that means l can do it.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.620
It's sophism.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.340
I can foresee a bad outcome,

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.340
l'm fed up with doing nothing
and letting it pass.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.740
Please.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.500
Just forget what happened
when you worked at the bank.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.780
First, l'll get the whole picture
of what is going on.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.880
Then, analyse it based on that,

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.820
come up with ways to deal
with the incident and solve it.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.820
- Please go home.
- No, it's fine.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.140
- It's fine.
- Please.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.770
- What's going on?
- l will go and buy it.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.580
I don't want to cause you trouble,
so l'll go myself from now on.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.570
What happened?

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.370
We've been talking
about what to eat for supper.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.860
Let her eat what she wants.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.660
- No...
- You got it wrong.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.290
I wanted to have
deep-fried meat cake

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.850
and Misato prepared it for me.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.580
You shouldn't eat that.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:50.450
Yes. The doctor stressed that
l shouldn't eat anything deep-fried.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.980
What are you doing?

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.660
Mum insisted on having it.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.020
Is that so?

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.010
I am sorry.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.650
I was being childish.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.050
There are more and more things
l can't do when l grow old,

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.980
so l say l want to eat this
or l want to do this

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.020
and use words
to take my mind off it.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.100
But Misato takes
what l say seriously.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:18.520
On top of that, she made a meat cake
as big as a sandal.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.360
When l saw it,

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.310
it made me feel so sorry for myself,

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.090
that my health is too bad for me
to eat it.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.520
Okay, mum. lt's okay.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.250
Do you enjoy making old people cry?

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.170
Of course l don't enjoy it!

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.180
You should at least
make it bite size.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.340
How can you make it like a scandal?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.100
Or you can make soy pulp croquette.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.380
From this morning,
for the whole day,

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.070
your mother
has been saying this nonstop,

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.680
"Fried meat cake..."

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.090
She has been chanting that!

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:02.920
What's wrong?

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:06.040
I thought l would do anything
to stop her meat cake chanting

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.280
and l did my best
to make a huge meat cake.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.400
Can you imagine just a bit
how l felt at that time?

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.200
Don't shout. lt's embarrassing!

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.920
Sorry, l haven't done good enough.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.970
I will go and buy something else.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.360
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.280
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.720
Nana, do you want to hang out
somewhere this weekend?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.840
Why?

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.360
We haven't been to anywhere
since we moved here.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.840
Many things happened.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.960
I'm not in the mood.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.920
Many things happened, that's exactly
why we should go out for a change.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.720
Yeah. l'll think about it.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.520
At least go to the city office,
then.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.640
It's time to register our marriage.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.880
I actually wanted you to say that.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.210
Sorry. l am not in the mood
to do that even more.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.630
All right.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.330
Then...

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.520
Let's do something
we can do at home.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.220
What will we do?

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.960
Let's have a bath together.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.880
That's what you mean?

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.640
Now?

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.520
- It's too sudden.
- l suddenly want to do it.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.200
I have to do something.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.920
Why? You have been going out
every night lately!

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.720
Not every night. Just twice, right?

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.400
What?

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.040
Okay, then.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.920
Let's fix a date.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.440
What do you mean?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.800
I won't arrange anything
on that day,

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.720
and l won't make myself too tired
during the day.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.840
But l don't mean
l want to do it so vigorously,

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.560
and l don't want to schedule it.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.880
We do that when our feelings
bond together,

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.720
then our bodies bond together too.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.280
Don't say it like a girl.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.640
Fine!

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.820
I'll satisfy my unfulfilled desire

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.900
by turning it
into the desire for food!

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.820
Just look.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.120
Look closely
at how l eat the lettuce!

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.960
Look and think
that l really love you!

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.280
Okay.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.280
Come here.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.680
See you.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.740
Shota!

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.620
Oh, Ono. Good morning.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.300
You look happy.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.380
You can tell?

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.780
Could you have expected
to have a present from me?

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.140
Oh, what is it?

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.840
Ono, this way...

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.220
They're sweet rice crackers.
l made them.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.060
The rice, the oil and the syrup used
are all organic.

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.740
You can make sweet rice crackers
yourself?

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.060
Tell me what you think next time.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.320
I'm in a hurry.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.970
Touo University Hospital</i>

lt is your turn to kill.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.850
Yamagiwa was my classmate
in college.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:08.970
I've always hated him so much

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:11.730
that l wanted to pull his head off
many times.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.050
Someone recorded it.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.650
New email: lt is your turn to kill</i>

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.810

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.490
Hello, Mr Atsushi Fujii.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.330
Does this look familiar?

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.250
It is your bath towel.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:35.250
On the towel,

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:43.090
your DNA and Yutaro Yamagiwa's DNA
will be found.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.330
This and the voice recording
sent to you just now

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.000
will confirm
that you are the murderer.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.120
This is ridiculous!

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.490
But if you obey the rule
and do what you should,

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:05.450
l will take the responsibility
and dispose both of them.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.890
Now...

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.530
lt is your turn to kill!

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.130
Of course it isn't!

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.330
First of all...

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:24.650
l don't even know where the guy
l'm supposed to kill is!

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.490
The patient is waiting.
What are you doing?

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.730
Shut up! l am coming!

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.610
This guys is hopeless.
l want to kill him.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.410
I'll call the next patient in now.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.530
Okay, thanks.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.770
Number 214, Mr Tanaka.</i>

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.490
Mr Masao Tanaka.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.210
Tanaka?

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:49.610
Masao?

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.450
Who is this?

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.730
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.180
Number 214, Mr Tanaka.</i>

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.860
Mr Masao Tanaka.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.580
Tanaka?

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.100
Masao?

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:33.570
What...

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:38.380
Oh, my? You are a doctor?

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.980
The Bhutanese diner's...

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.850
l am the owner, Dorj. Cheers, mate!

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.740
Masao Tanaka</i>

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.860
But Tanaka...

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.900
Oh, l'm sorry.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.860
Actually, l am not Dorj.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.580
What do you mean?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.660
If a Bhutanese restaurant is run
by an Osaka guy with a thick accent,

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.020
it won't be popular.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.530
That's why l pretended to be
a Bhutanese guy.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.580
Like, "Welcome!"

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.330
That means you are...

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.700
Mr Masao Tanaka?

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:19.620
Yes.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.780
Bhutanese Cuisine, Dorj's Diner</i>

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.680
l will go home now.

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.210
You'll go now?

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.810
I have something to do.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.530
Come on, come and watch a DVD
at my place.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.620
I'm going to meet someone.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.540
With your friend
who is staying illegally?

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.180
If you don't want me to tell
the police about your friend,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.020
come and watch a DVD at my home!

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.460
Hey, this is nasty.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.900
I am not nasty!

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:27.860
I only want to watch a DVD with you
on my fluffy cushion.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.440
You get it, right?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.610
Slow and steady wins the case,
right?

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:36.270
I am home.</i>

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.780
You went on a date again?

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.700
We just met up after work.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.540
We had dinner, though.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.050
You can invite me occasionally too.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:49.970
Can we change the topic?

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.290
Yes, you can.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:54.180
Do you know Room 403's Fujii?

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.540
What about Fujii?

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.080
Fujii came and asked me whether you
and the diner's owner were friends.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.630
What time did he come?

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.490
The owner of the number you dialled
cannot answer your call.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:13.790
Please leave a message
after the tone.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.590
Sir! Mr Dorj!

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.510
Masao Tanaka!

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.470
Sir! Mr Dorj!

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.230
Masao Tanaka! Masao Tanaka!

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:29.310
Masao Tanaka!

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.230
Why? Xinyi, you sound desperate.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:35.910
Are you alive?

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:39.290
I am alive. l am very alive.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.370
Thank goodness!

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.290
Are you alone in the diner?

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:45.610
I am alone.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:49.570
Why? Have you made up your mind?

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.690
You should go home right now!

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.170
Should l?

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.100
Will you come to my home?

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.740
You should have taken my spare key.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:05.420
But now your friend is safe,
everyone is happy.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.580
What?

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.940
It doesn't matter,
you're totally my type.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.340
What can l do?

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.060
What are you talking about?

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.940
Xinyi, you lit up my heart.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:50.330

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.690
Nana, let's do
core training together!

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.490
Xinyi. Xinyi, come here.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.190
Come. Hurry!

Hurry up!

It is your turn to kill.</i>

Your Turn to Kill</i>

Your wife didn't tell you
about the game?

Shota found out his wife's lie</i>
Did she lie to you?

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:55.930
Maybe she wrote your name, Sho.

There is another murder--</i>
