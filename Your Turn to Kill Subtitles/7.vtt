"<i>Everyone must have someone
they want to kill.</i>"

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.520
l think this is what started it.</i>

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.720
We wrote the names of
the people we want to kill,</i>

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.720
and secretly showed each other.</i>

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.120
Right after that...</i>

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.040
The name l wrote was
Yutaro Yamagiwa.</i>

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.890
People are murdered
one after next.</i>

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.050
The name l wrote
on my piece of paper

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.130
was Misato Akaike.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.180
I wrote "Yoshihiko Hakamada"
on the piece of paper.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.710
Mr Fujii has been receiving
threatening notes.</i>

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.590
People are cornered.</i>

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.870
It's here already?

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.350
Even so, l think we should tell
the police about the game.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.550
All of us might be treated
as murderers for a while.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.750
I did nothing, so l don't want to be
treated as an accomplice!

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.790
We didn't talk to the police,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.150
And another person...

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.090
The name l wrote
was Mrs Kayo Kojima.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.450
On the other hand, l...</i>

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.450
l'm married to him.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.650
Divorce her!</i>

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.450
Nana wrote your name.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.890
My name?

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.570
Many things are happening.</i>

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.370
We just got involved
and are tossed about by them.</i>

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.010
What the heck?

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.010
Who are you?

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.290
Ghost? This flat's?
The murdered couple's?

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.610
Why don't you say something?
You scare me!

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.770
- Who are you?
- You suddenly spoke! Scary!

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850
But l live here.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.570
l'm the caretaker here.
Starting today.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.800
"Kojima Kids' English Class"

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440
Let's go.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.520
Calm down, we're only going to
talk to you.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.720
You totally suspect me.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.120
Let us.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080
It's our job to suspect people.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.880
What's the matter?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.280
Another person was killed.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.160
lf l say this now,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600
you might think that
l'm a horrible person,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.560
but l don't think it's my fault.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.680
No, it isn't.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.320
At that time too,
l didn't want to do it at all,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.750
but everyone said we would do it.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.880
I understand.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.360
It was the same for me, too.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.440
Who drew my piece of paper?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640
I have no idea.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.510
We should tell the police.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.950
- But--
- Let's tell them.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.870
Will l be treated as a suspect?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.170
If they do, Sora--

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.890
lf you care about Sora,

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.850
you should rely
on the police more.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.430
But...

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.400
Mrs Kitagawa can't make up her mind.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.360
Nana, if it is to protect you,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.360
l don't care
what the neighbours think.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.800
Frankly, even if l have to
cause someone trouble,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.360
l still want to protect Nana.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.720
It isn't the point.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.960
I don't think this is right,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.820
but if it is to protect Nana,

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.920
l can ignore my reputation,
social rules and everything.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.950
Isn't it how far you're prepared to
go to protect Sora?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.460
Let's talk to the police.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.420
Great! Let's go right now.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.210
Look out.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.980
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.780
Did Sanae tell you?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.980
My wife has the same worry too,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.060
that you'd be arrested
for inducing the commitment

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.940
- or assisting a murder.
- Yes.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.260
You can count on him regarding that.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.620
I'm CID's Kamiya,
you can tell me anything.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.980
Is it okay to think that
l won't be arrested?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.070
Yes, as long as l'm in charge.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.340
But some officers might treat
all the residents here as suspects,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.700
that's how tricky this case is.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.300
Make sure you don't tell
another detective.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.020
Okay, we won't tell anyone.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.300
"Nishio Recycle"

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.030
Hey.

Ukita?

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.340
We agreed not to meet
for the rest of our lives.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.060
I know.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.340
What are you here for, then?

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.260
If you want the money
we stole together,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.540
l had spent all of it
a long time ago.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.860
Your daughter wants to meet you.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.500
What daughter?

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.780
The daughter you had
with Naoko Seno.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.740
What?

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.140
She is 21 now

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.140
and she is going to get married.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.860
Her future husband wants her father
to attend the ceremony,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.540
and asked me to look for you.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.620
You came to see me just for that?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.790
I see. But she's just a kid
whose name l don't even know.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.550
I don't want to get caught now.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.830
It's Airi.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.230
It's Airi Seno.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.850
She's a bit unruly,
but she's a very nice girl.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.490
Please say yes.

Sanae's husband stepped in,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.290
and we've reported the game
to the police.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.710
We can let the police
handle the rest.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.390
Mr Kuzumi?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.230
Oh, yeah.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.590
Okay.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.900
Why didn't you tell me?

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.100
You were too late to tell me
about the game.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.410
It was because you said
if the police found out now,

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.030
it would affect your promotion.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.550
Well, l got someone reliable
to help me with that.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.670
The radio is noisy.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.870
Someone reliable?

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.190
Well, anyway,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.160
tell the other people to
let the police handle the rest.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.360
The radio.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.230
Why don't you turn it off yourself?

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.470
Please participate--</i>

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.030
Come on, please!

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.590
You're so annoying.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.400
I'll buy this too, okay?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.000
I didn't know that you were so kind.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.460
Why do you care about that kid?

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.720
After Naoko gave birth
to Airi,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.790
she asked me to babysit Airi.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.350
You grew fond of her
just because of that?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.610
Shut up.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.430
Fine. You don't have to attend
the ceremony,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.750
but will you at least
go to see her once?

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.750
Please!

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.070
Come on!

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.630
All right.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.710
Thank you.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.470
You can probably meet your dad.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.110
Despite his looks,
Mr Ukita is capable.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.710
Will we really do that?

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.870
- It's too late to get scared.
- l'm not scared!

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.630
Listen, if you want to marry me,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.230
find my stupid dad and kill him.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.150
Don't forget that.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.120
But do you hate a man
you've never met before so much?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.760
I can say that mummy was killed
by that jerk.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.960
She worked too hard on her own,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.980
it ruined her health
and caused her death.

"Series of murder
at Kuramae's condo"

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:48.540
We have verified that the leg found
belonged to Kayo Kojima.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.420
The flat wasn't broken into, right?

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.240
If there wasn't a burglary,
could the husband have killed her?

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.600
I doubt it.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200
To sum up, you went to a flat
that isn't your home?

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.320
Yes, it was a close...

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.440
colleague's home.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.480
She is a lady l can talk to
about my private matters.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.080
In other words,
you were at your lover's home.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.320
- Have you been listening?
- Am l wrong?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.200
No, you are not wrong.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.880
Her husband was at his lover's home
at the victim's EOD.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.840
Could the lover have planned

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.800
and murdered Kayo Kojima
with the husband?

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.440
We're checking the CCTVs
in the lover's neighbourhood.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.960
Good. Also, the body's--

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.320
What's wrong?

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.900
It makes me scared
just to hear the word "body,"

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.940
let's call a body "pad thai"
from now on.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.080
Mizuki, how long have you been
a detective?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.040
Hang on.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.820
What is pad thai?

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.500
Sorry, l am late.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.860
Kamiya, tell him what pad thai is.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.340
Something like Thai cuisine's
fried rice noodles.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.460
Well done.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.420
What are you talking about?

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.460
We're saying that only the leg of
the "pad thai" is found.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.460
What?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.060
Where have you been anyway?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.100
I went to check
who posted the golf bag.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.540
You've been acting on your own
lately.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.300
- Did you find anything?
- Yes, sir.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.900
The handwriting on the receipt
should be Kayo Kojima's,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.440
but a young man
brought the bag there.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.440
He talked to me
when l was delivering parcels.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.400
He had the invoice,
so l took the order.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.600
I think he was in his early 20s.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.440
Is there a man in his early 20s
among the residents?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.700
Yes, sir.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.970
Room 201's Ryo Kakinuma,

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.810
and Room 404's Yuki Etou.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.850
What are you talking about?

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.010
I'm going to be killed!

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.900
No, you won't. lt's just a game.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.850
But now Mrs Kojima
has become just a leg!

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.130
It's because she had a fight
with her husband.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.570
You mean her husband killed her?

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.210
I have no idea, but it has nothing
to do with the game.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.490
I'm home.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.050
Don't just act normal!

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.730
Mummy, is supper ready?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.220
I'm not in the mood to cook!

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.540
Don't take it out on the children.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.380
Mr Ukita.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.740
You...

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.680
"lt is your turn to kill"

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.900
l see.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.890
What about you?

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.170
"It is your turn to kill"

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.490
What should we do?

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:41.850
What do you mean?

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.990
Mr Fujii was threatened
and he really committed a murder.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.470
That's what l think.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.820
I won't do it just because of
this threatening note.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.990
Okay.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.950
But who did this?

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.170
Exactly!

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.490
The handwriting is the same?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.770
They're the same, aren't they?

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.330
This is strange.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.410
Why?

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.810
There is a murder-swap.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.370
You wrote Misato Akaike,

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.930
and l wrote Yoshihiko Hakamada,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.090
two people drew them respectively,

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.410
and they are threatening us,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.410
saying that it's our turn now.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.530
I see.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.930
"Paper drawn by: A, B"

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.930
The people who threaten us
should be two different persons,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.490
but the handwriting on them
is the same.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.050
What should l do?

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.130
What should you do?

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.810
Don't do anything.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.140
Okay.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.310
What do you mean?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.390
To sum up,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.790
the people who we don't know
what they wrote

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.270
are Mr Tamiya,

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.030
Miss Ono,

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.310
and the caretaker, right?

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.910
But the names that
we don't know written by whom...

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.350
"Yoshimura, Oda Nobunaga"

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.150
are this many.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.110
The order is different,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.950
but the names written and drawn
should match perfectly.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.510
Isn't this strange?

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.710
Why are they so different?

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.950
I think some people lied.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.400
What for?

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:39.100
Also, it's possible that someone
drew their own piece of paper.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.100
We can't be sure that
all pieces of paper were swapped.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.750
The probability is
around 37 percent.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.750
But maybe the deduction
that it's a murder-swap

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.870
fails in the first place.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:20.470
Here. lt says Mr Ukita
killed Mr Hakamada,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.470
but the name Mr Ukita drew
was old Mrs Akaike.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.270
That means Mr Ukita lied?

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:33.430
Even so, l don't think Mr Kuzumi
killed Mrs Kojima after that.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.470
I wrote this.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.590
What?

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.790
So please, don't kill him.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:44.710
If you say that,
nobody seems to have killed her.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.110
My Kuzumi probably did that.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.870
You'd better not trust him too much.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.470
Is there anything else?

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.710
No.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:01.260
Let's say something more positive.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.200
Mrs Kojima passed away and
Ms Kitagawa wrote her name, right?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.240
Yeah.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.920
But the piece of paper drawn by
Ms Kitagawa was blank.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.320
I see.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.400
There's nobody to kill.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.040
No. lf it's a murder-swap,
it will stop here, right?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.000
But actually,
the order doesn't matter, does it?

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.480
Why?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.780
Because if the caretaker didn't
commit suicide and he was killed,

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.270
the murderer didn't kill him
because it was their turn,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.190
they just killed him.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.510
They weren't threatened,

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.150
but they still killed someone?
What kind of person is that?

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.870
Someone who hated the caretaker
very much from the start?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.310
Was there anybody?

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.470
Ready, start!

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.830
Are you saying that
we will really break up for real?

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:03.750
Yeah.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.790
- Excuse me, the bill, please!
- l haven't finished!

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:08.710
We have totally finished!

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.150
Waiter, your turn.

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:18.630
I'm a waiter.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.070
I'm a waiter at a pub.

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.840
I am a waiter,
the head of part-time workers.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.910
- Mr Tamiya?
- Excuse me, l'm concentrating.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:29.240
But it's your turn--

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880
Okay, l got the idea.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960
Just go and act.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.390
What?

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.710
Go and act.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.460
You're the director, so maybe l am
teaching a fish how to swim

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.760
but whatever an actor does,
he needs a motive.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.950
I can't come out just because
it is written in the script,

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.830
or l'll be following it blindly.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.190
You can also say that
l am the writer's slave.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:01.150
Now, l need a motive
to make my appearance here.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.270
And your motive is
the customer asked for the bill!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.390
You just go along with the writer
and that's your interpretation,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.430
but l interpret it in my own way!

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.950
Start from a bit earlier. Go!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.190
- Excuse me, the bill, please!
- Certainly, sir.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.910
- I'll really walk you home.
- What do you want?

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.860
I am your bodyguard.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:36.700
Your beloved Nana wants me dead.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.180
Yes. lt seems that you are
the most awful jerk.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.100
Even so, l still don't think
it's okay if you die.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.500
An awful jerk
has the right to live, too.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.760
By the way, Nana said there was just
one thing that she couldn't forgive,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.560
so she wanted a divorce.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.560
Do you know what it is?

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.040
How would l know that?

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.840
Wait, you're so upset that you're
speaking in your native dialect.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.960
Shut up!

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.160
Tell me, stupid Big Bro!

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800
Stupid Bro!

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.460
Nothing serious happened
for a while after that.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:29.460
However...

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.060
it also means that
the murderers haven't been caught.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.540
Kazuo, what's the matter?

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.390
I wanted to play with Yohei.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.310
Did you have another fight with him?

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:47.710
No.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.830
Yohei's mum said if he went to
my home, he would be killed

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.470
and didn't let him come.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.070
We all think that the murderers are
among our neighbours.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.670
We've been doubting each other
every day.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.990
It is sorted properly.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.110
It's not fun.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.110
Hey.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.800
You live in Room 401, right?

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.000
You've been cleaning the place, does
it mean l don't have to do that?

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.380
Yeah.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.840
Lately, there is no need
to clean it anyway.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.880
Residents here
value public morality.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.720
I doubt it.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.210
To make people obey the rules,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.280
fear is the best method, right?

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.960
Lately, people here try to avoid
being hated,

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.250
and they all behave themselves.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.410
She's so...

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.170
cute.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.530
- The three of us?
- Yes.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.450
I think Big Bro has calmed down
quite a lot.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.410
I think you two can talk properly.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:09.450
I think he would agree
to get a divorce now.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:15.210
Sorry, too many things happened and
l put what's important behind me.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:20.410
It's fine. People died.
lt's totally fine to do that later.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.990
I'm the type who didn't do
summer homework until the last day.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.950
They're two different matters.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.590
When l am with you,

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:32.550
l am having a summer vacation
that will never end.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.450
That's how l feel.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.180
So 31st August doesn't come for us.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.450
We can put everything that isn't fun
behind us.

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:47.530
But if l don't
finish my homework first,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.090
l'll keep thinking about it
and l can't enjoy my vacation.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.650
I see.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.930
Let's talk about it, then.
l'll ask Big Bro his schedule.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.090
Nana, smile for me once.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.530
Just force yourself to.
Smile for me.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.620
What the heck?

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.220
When you smile, l smile.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.100
When l smile, you smile.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.410
Let's smile together
and overcome everything.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.290
Thank you.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.330
"JG Maintenance"

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.890
Would you like salty or sweet bread?

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:46.770
A sweet one, please.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.610
Okay. l'll go buy it.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.650
"It is your turn to kill"

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.450
Who is this?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.130
Who drew my piece of paper?

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.130
"Yoshihiko Hakamada"

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.250
Who drew it?

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.300
I don't know!

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.690
Thanks for waiting.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.290
Oh, thanks.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.360
- What are these?
- Yes?

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.050
I haven't seen them.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.890
What photos are these?

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.490
It's my parents' home.

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:13.970
Yes?

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:23.770
Hey, who gave you these?

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.650
I really don't know.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.910
You are really annoying.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.030
Don't come to the gym
if you hate it so much.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.870
I thought you'd hate to see me!
Will you cut it out?

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.430
I know how you feel.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.710
If in the very unlikely case that
Nana and l have to get divorced,

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.070
l'm going to complain too.
Just like you, stupid Big Bro.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.390
Stop calling me that!

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.110
That's how good Nana is.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.780
Let's go, Stupid Bro.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.460
Don't make variations!

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.860
- "Stupid Bro" is good, right?
- No!

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.630
Isn't it better than Stupid Big Bro?

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:13.650
It isn't!

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.930
I can't do it!

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.170
Shota.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.330
Is it okay if l walk home with you?

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.250
You don't sound okay with it.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:50.210
I am just a bit tired.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.390
Are you going to dump me?

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.110
What?

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.810
You grew tired and you'll dump me?

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.650
Hang on, l've never--

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.930
Don't say you had never thought
l was your girlfriend!

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.730
I'll say that. l am married.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.290
You're awful.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.530
You see, l'm truly in love
with Nana.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.010
I am scary.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.290
What?

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.650
If anybody dumps me like this...

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.690
l am scary.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.750
Wait a minute, Miss Ono.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.490
Wait, you...

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.610
What? You've got to be kidding!

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.130
Nana...

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:47.610
You startled me! Welcome home.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.310
I hit the bull's eye!

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.310
Yes?

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.470
Do you remember what l deduced
about the caretaker's death?

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.960
It was...

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.720
Maybe they were in
a romantic relationship?

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.080
Then things got ugly.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.200
You remember?

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520
Yes, and?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.000
Just now, l bumped into Miss Ono
on my way home.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.520
We talked a bit,

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.560
she really is the type that would
commit a crime of passion!

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.920
Why do you think so?

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.120
Anyway, l think we should
dig further into this.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.040
You'll see her, right?

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.600
You promised.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.760
Tomorrow?

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.240
All right, then.
l'll bring her there.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.200
See you.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.960
Daddy! Daddy!

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:57.970
Airi.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.930
I'm not your daddy,
call me Mr Ukita.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:05.450
Why? l want a daddy, too.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:08.330
Yeah? But...

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.370
Mr Ukita...

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.970
be my daddy.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.450
I am not your daddy.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.610
"Master key"

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.530
What?

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:32.890
It's gone.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.970
"Manager's office"

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:38.850
What the heck?

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:43.370
Hey.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.530
How have you been?
ls anybody threatening you?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.170
They'll set your parent's home
on fire if you don't kill?

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.530
Darn! Who is this?

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.170
I'm thinking that
it's a certain person.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.250
I had no idea
that it would get so serious,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.090
but l was being careful

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.970
and l did a trick
when l wrote the name.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.850
Because of that,
l have a rough idea about

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.810
who drew my piece of paper
with "Misato Akaike" on it.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:20.130
Who is it, then?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.320
Really?

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.690
I'll go and check that now.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.520
I am a busy man too, so l'll get rid
of the trouble quickly.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.320
- I'll go with you.
- No.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.880
My guess might not be correct,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.160
so l will go alone and try to
get the truth out of them.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.080
All right, then.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:18.530
Are you both nervous?
l guess you don't know what to say.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.490
You don't look like me.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.690
Are you really my daughter?

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.050
Naoko had been fooling around.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.010
Hey!

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.770
Is it Naoko's fault
that you're so ill-mannered?

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.970
Or is it yours?

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.570
Wait! Sorry, l want to talk to her.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:41.970
What are you talking about?

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.130
I know why you snapped,
but you should talk--

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.210
Sorry.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.290
I made up my mind before l came.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.610
Hey.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.820
Die a hundred times, you jerk!

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.860
Hey!

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.410
Mr Ukita...

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:25.130
You...

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.650
l am sorry!

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.650
Why?

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.170
Airi wants revenge for her mother.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.890
Forget it. l expected this.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.450
- Call an ambulance!
- Okay!

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.050
I'm stabbed, the ambulance crew
will call the police.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.130
I don't care!

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.760
You should care. Yeah?

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.640
I won't let you have
a criminal record.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.160
I'll call an ambulance myself.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.210
You two, just leave!

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.170
Let's do what he says.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.170
Your father...

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.810
Sorry, l didn't realise that
you hated him so much,

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.650
that you'd want to kill him.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.490
In that case...

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.530
it can be me, right?

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:22.360
Yes?

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.520
Think of me as your father.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.050
Why out of the blue?

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:34.890
Because...

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:38.770
Call an ambulance
right after we leave!

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.130
Sure. So just go now!

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.800
I'll see you at the hospital.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.920
Sure.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.200
When l see you at the hospital...

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.160
l will call you daddy.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.520
Sure.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:24.890
Hey.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.810
Ukita?

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.690
Have you left?

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:34.650
Why did he do this?

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.320
Is it you, Ukita?

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.330
Ukita?

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.450
Hey.

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.090
Hello? Police?

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.480
Someone died in my shop's toilet.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.360
What? lt's...

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.680
someone l don't know.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:04.890
This is ridiculous...

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.050
This is my fault.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.890
It's because
l tried to kill that jerk.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.780
It can be me, right?

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.940
Think of me as your father.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.500
Since a long time ago,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.220
l have always wanted you
to be my daddy.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.320
Mr Ukita.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.800
Be my daddy.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.150
Daddy!

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.580
I don't really care,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.980
but my company told me to check.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.060
But we aren't.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.620
It's pointless to tell me.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:19.300
What happened?

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.660
Because of what happened
to Mr Ukita,

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.780
the company found out
that they're gangsters.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.720
What happened to him?

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.130
Isn't it too late? We all know.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.850
- Whose funeral did they attend?
- What?

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.050
Mr Ukita's, of course.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:36.290
What?

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.850
He was killed.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.530
I will go and check it now.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.620
Good morning.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.500
Why don't you work somewhere
outside our flat for now?

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.740
- But--
- Go to my gym.

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.620
Work at the break room.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.390
Okay.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.310
- Please take this.
- Okay.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.750
I'll go to work.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.030
Thank you.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.470
- Sorry that we came uninvited.
- lt's okay.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.590
I think Big Bro will come
in the afternoon.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.070
Okay.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:42.230
Feel free to relax here.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.030
What is going on now?

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.910
Do you think that
everything is my fault?

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:00.250
Why?

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.690
Of course we don't.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.470
But Mr Kuzumi said this to me, too.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.270
He asked if all of these
were a trap that l had set.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:10.830
Do you two--

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:12.430
We don't think it is.

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:14.950
Right?

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:22.070
I love how gentle you are

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:27.830
and the smile on your face
when you are with Shota.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.700
No, l just...

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.950
You see, a while ago...

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.470
When someone says
something horrible to me,

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:46.110
l say something nice
to someone twice.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:50.030
So because someone said
something horrible to you,

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.220
l said two nice things to you.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.700
Okay. Thank you.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.430
Excuse me,
did Mr Hosokawa come today?

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.630
I haven't seen him today.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.870
He's usually here
before his personal training time.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.470
Idiot, l'm at the warehouse already.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.070
Don't apologise. You shouldn't make
your managing director do it.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.160
The ladies said they felt safe
that we could stay together.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.680
Okay, come every day, then.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.560
But it'll be annoying
if we come every day.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.760
Come every day.
Come eight days a week.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.480
What are you talking about?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.840
What's the matter?

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.920
Well, in the end,
Big Bro didn't come.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.080
I felt a bit relieved, though.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.290
Is he all right?

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:56.470
I have absolutely no idea
where it is.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:59.310
The labels? l'm looking for it.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.040
Just stop talking and come here!

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.640
Hello.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.520
What's the matter?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.080
I got a bit lost.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.800
Our company rents the whole floor,
l think it should be another floor.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.360
"Shota Tezuka"

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.920
What's the matter?

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.520
Hello?

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.080
Hello?

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.000
He hung up.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.880
Did you mistake me for someone?

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.160
Could it be Nana's
murder-swap or something?

00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.890
You know?

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.890
Calm down and think!
Do you kill just for a game?

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.510
I'll be killed if l don't kill you!

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.190
Tell the police first!

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.590
I can't count on them!

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.630
They told the police,

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.790
but Mr Ukita was killed.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:15.440
Mr Ukita?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.640
Room 201's gorilla-like...

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120
No.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.280
Baboon-like guy!

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.520
I don't know him!

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.600
Can you solve any problem
by killing me?

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.920
You'll only become a murderer.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.840
If there is no motive,

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.400
nobody will find out
that it's a murder-swap.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:40.120
That's when unrelated people
commit murder for each other,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.120
but you know Nana now, right?

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.000
The plan fails because of that.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.670
You'll only be suspected and
arrested like the usual cases.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.000
I made the suggestion.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.760
I intended it to be a game,
of course.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.040
I had no idea
that this would happen!

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.360
Calm down, okay?

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.430
What am l doing?

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.510
Gosh!

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.080
I have to go, then.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.600
Why don't you run away
to your parents' home?

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.550
If l run away,
someone is going to harm my family.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.240
I am sorry!

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.200
Please don't tell anyone.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.030
Pardon?

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:36.680
Please...

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.120
Don't tell anyone about this.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.750
Sure, l won't.
Don't come any closer.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.700
- I won't do anything.
- Don't move!

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.660
Sorry.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:48.900
It's fine.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.030
Oh? You, well...

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:01.180
You look like Mr Hakamada?

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.340
Oh, yes.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.710
That's my only characteristic.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.040
It isn't a bad thing.
lt's the best to be common.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.640
Yes.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.570
But usually people
can't kill another person.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:27.280
What?

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.760
I've been doing maintenance
for lifts for 20 years!

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.920
Yes?

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:22.000
Excuse me, l am
Sumida Police Station's Kamiya.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.280
- You...
- Sorry for coming so early.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.780
Please come to the police station
with us.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.420
"Your Turn to Kill"

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.420
- You are the murderer?
- l had no idea.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.380
She wants to run.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.820
All of us are accomplices!

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.380
You are free to suspect me.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.340
It's true that l lied.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.900
"Who is the liar?"

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:02.380
Please.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.340
I don't understand
why you do that pose.
