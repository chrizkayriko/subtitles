00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.090
Everyone must have someone
they want to kill.</i>

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.570
l think this is what started it.</i>

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.170
We wrote the name of the person
we want to kill half-jokingly</i>

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.170
and secretly showed each other.</i>

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.650
Right after that...</i>

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.290
When we still couldn't believe it,</i>

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.090
some people have killed someone,</i>

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.850
the person who had someone killed
for them kills someone else...</i>

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.890
Perhaps</i>.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.800
You wrote the diner's owner's name?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.690
I didn't think he would be killed.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.850
Your wife didn't tell you?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.890
It's the murder-swap game.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.570
Your husband is here.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.280
What is the "murder-swap game"?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.840
Then, again...</i>

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.240
Mrs Akaike!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.800
I'll call the police!

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.720
Old Mrs Akaike!

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.840
(Oh, my Julia!)

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.520
Mrs Akaike!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.800
Misato Akaike</i>

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.310
The entrance's door was unlocked?

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.310
Yes.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.830
The window was opened too.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.150
Only the four of us
entered the flat.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.070
Shota, are you okay?

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.750
Yeah, l am okay.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.310
But there's blood on your foot...

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.150
lt isn't my blood.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.790
What happened?

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.870
Good evening, sir.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.300
Good evening, sir...

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.500
Drive the people outside away!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.540
Yes, sir.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.350
- Go now!
- Yes, sir!

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.780
How many people died?

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.620
Two. Look directly at them.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.060
But l am scared!

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.670
Are you okay?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.670
I guess not.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.270
Why don't we move away from here?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.910
Okay. Well, we have a mortgage,
so it's a bit hard,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.510
but if we rent out the flat,
we can get some money,

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.190
but under this situation...

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.320
What will happen to the person
l wrote on my piece of paper later?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.860
I can't search anything
if we move away.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.180
Let's save moving away as
our last resort.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.140
Why?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.900
Because l mentioned money again?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.140
Sorry, but we'll be okay.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.860
I think we should move away
even if it'll be tough.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.420
I'm scared, but the police will come
to investigate this for a while,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.620
so maybe l feel safest here.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.540
What? But l am scared!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.780
Don't cry.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.660
Nana, go to bed with me.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.500
Sorry, l'll send
a business email first.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.580
At a time like this?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.580
I'll send an email to ask
if they can extend the deadline.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.180
Xinyi wrote Masao Tanaka?</i>

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.380
<i>Misato Akaike</i>

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.140
Did Xinyi kill Misato?</i>

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.060
Nana, have you finished?

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.110
Your Turn to Kill

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.390
Episode 5

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.510
We presume that the weapon is an 8
to 15 centimetres long knife,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.430
but we have not found it so far.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.590
Did the old lady in the flat
say anything after that?

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.870
No, she kept mumbling something,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.870
but she didn't answer
any of our questions.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.670
Are any of the residents suspicious?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.950
The people whose whereabouts
we can't locate at the EOD are...

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.010
201's Keisuke Ukita,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.750
Ryo Kakinuma,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.310
Airi Seno.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.510
203's...

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.590
Sorry.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.590
203's Xinyi Lin,

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.390
204's Jun Nishimura,

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.630
301's Mikiha Ono

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.950
and the flat next door,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.350
501's Go Sano.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.190
Why are the photos like that?

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.350
They were taken secretly
during the interview.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.550
They all look like killers to me.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.680
Also, we lifted fingerprints
other than the victims' in the flat.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.580
They are 201's Airi Seno,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.660
202's Sawa Kuroshima,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
203's Iqbal Bin Dato,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.460
302's Nana Tezuka,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.980
404's Yuki Etou.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.040
We found these people's
fingerprints.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.540
The one who left fingerprints
in the flat

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.900
and has no alibi is...

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.540
This girl?

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.230
- I'm counting on you!
- Yes, sir...

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.910
Hey, take this with you.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.630
What? lt's salt again?

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.550
The residential tower is cursed!

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.030
Indeed.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.550
The property manager killed himself
last month,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.270
a diner exploded and the owner died,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.420
the waitress...

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.300
and a regular customer live there.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.870
On top of that, the customer found
the body of the murder victims.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.300
Hey, speaking of which, why didn't
you report these just now?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.270
Do you remember Mr Enomoto?

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.340
- Mr Kamiya.
- Yes?

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.460
Good evening.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.820
Enomoto lives there too. And?

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.070
He indirectly put pressure on me.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.030
Enomoto?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:20.630
Hey.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.670
He seems to want to be promoted
one rank up from lnspector,

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.470
so he cares about his reputation.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.030
Whether he can be a Superintendent,
the boss's appraisal matters.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.710
So about what happened
at the residential tower...

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.650
Nowadays, you never know
what will be against your favour.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.790
Well, l don't need to hide anything,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.830
but don't you think
you don't need

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.310
to make connections between
everything and make a fuss?

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.230
What?

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.550
Just because he happens to live
in the condo that a murder happened?

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.550
It won't affect his promotion!

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.790
That's what l said too, but...

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.630
Well, this isn't important,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.190
but the Deputy Chief
is waiting for my promotion.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.030
If officers of his faction
are at the best possible positions,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.590
it's easier for him to work too.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.830
At a time like this,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.830
if my chance of being promoted
is lost because of you guys,

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.670
what will the Deputy Chief think?

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.150
In that case, do as Enomoto wishes.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.470
What?

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.110
Idiot! lf you get dragged
into an organisation's trouble,

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:34.110
it'll be even scarier than a curse.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.270
Alibi not verified</i>

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.350
Room 203, Xinyi Lin</i>

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.560
Smoking is not allowed
inside the building.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.470
Smoking isn't allowed
outside the building too!

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.600
Are you serious?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.260
Yes.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.740
I think we should tell the police
about the game.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.340
l think it's important information
for catching the murderer this time.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.450
You relate it with the game again?

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.760
Actually,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.240
there was a birthday cake
at Mrs Akaike's flat,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.160
and "Misato Akaike" was written
on the chocolate plaque.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.160
Usually it should say
"Happy birthday, someone," right?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.340
But it was only the name,
Misato Akaike.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.100
What? You say that Mrs Akaike

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.060
was killed in the game
based on that?

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:12.980
That's all?

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.860
Not based on that, but...

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.100
lt's the same as saying that someone
among us killed Mr and Mrs Akaike.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.580
That's not what l mean.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.460
What do you mean, then?

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.980
Actually...

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.540
l also think that it's better
if we tell the police,

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.220
but...

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.300
what about the inducement of murder
we talked about the other day?

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.540
I don't know very well either.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.540
I didn't do anything,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.360
so l don't want to be seen
as the murderer's accomplice.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.920
Mrs lshizaki,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.480
didn't you say you wrote your name
on the piece of paper?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.220
Make sure you don't kill me
by mistake.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.260
Yes, so?

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.340
Instead of worrying
about being killed,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.660
you worry more about being seen
as an accomplice?

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.700
What's your point?

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.020
I just thought you were the murderer
for a bit.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.900
What? You...

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.910
Sorry, l am late.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.660
Are you all right?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.440
Why do you ask?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.020
Mrs Tamiya
said you weren't feeling well.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.280
I am all right. What's the topic?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.800
Mrs Tezuka suggests that we should
tell the police about the game.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.400
I'll let you make the decision.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.500
We can't reach a conclusion
on our own,

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.980
so we would like your opinion.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.620
Yes?

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.220
I have looked it up,

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.220
and l don't think we'll be arrested.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.460
Really?

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.310
But all of us could be treated
as murderers for a while.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.710
- That would be awful.
- But...

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.350
We'll be in trouble
if gossip magazines sniff anything.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.790
They'll say this is a condo full
of murder suspects and cause a stir.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.990
I think you're exaggerating it.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.150
Murderers' condo</i>

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.110
lf they add an exclamation mark
and a question mark,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.030
they can write
almost anything they want.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.550
It's over if they do this.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.510
Even if we're found innocent
at the end,

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.430
it'll stay on the internet forever.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.590
Mrs lshizaki,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.730
your children's classmates will call
your kids "murderer's children."

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.650
Our properties' value
will drop rapidly too.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.030
It's like our whole residential
tower is a stigmatised property.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.780
Fujii got most desperate
and he's suspicious.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.820
Don't make fun of me!

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.860
Fine.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.420
How can you be so calm?

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.380
We are all terrified!

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.900
Are you calm
because you're the murderer?

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.140
What do you mean?

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.300
This isn't right.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.220
- Miss Ono.
- Please calm down.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.960
- Mrs lshizaki too.
- What do you mean?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.520
- You said l was the murderer!
- l didn't.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.120
You did!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.040
Among these three people?

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.160
Did they come to buy
a birthday cake?

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.360
I don't remember their faces.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.520
Did you keep the receipt?

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.320
We did, just a moment, please.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.000
Well...

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.800
You are scared because Mrs Tezuka
wants to report us to the police.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.280
"Report"?

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.840
You guys are fishy because
you are afraid of the police.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.520
Let's calm down.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.040
You see, someone knocked his hand on
the desk and injured himself before.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.560
Yes, l did.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.080
Sorry for causing you trouble.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.400
It's totally healed now.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.960
I'm not young anymore,
I'm ashamed of what l did...

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.480
l am sorry.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.400
Yes?

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.360
I was joking.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240
What joke?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.240
You don't get it, old man.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.200
Mr Tamiya's seriousness isn't funny
at all,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.640
but it makes me happy to see it
after a long while.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.400
In the end,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.000
what are we going to do?

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.520
I have been living here for years,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.960
so l know that none of us
is a murderer.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.200
But Mrs Tezuka just moved here,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.520
so l think she just
doesn't understand that.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.680
Please don't blame her.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.720
The murderer wasn't caught
on camera, Mr Tamiya?

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.800
You put many in the building.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.960
I haven't been recording lately.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.000
What were you trying to do, then?

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.440
I feel ashamed of myself.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.320
Everyone, l am sorry.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.560
First of all,
were Mr and Mrs Akaike murdered?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.760
They could be having a fight
and it turned ugly.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.200
Relating it to the game

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.260
based on the chocolate plaque
is unreasonable.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.320
I think the couple
didn't have a fight.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.400
Right?

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.690
Let the police investigate this.

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:28.960
If it's just a hunch,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.250
it's pointless if our mere guesses
make things awkward between us.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.170
Then we have to tell them
about the game.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.410
Then we need everyone's consent.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.330
Someone joined the game,
but is absent today.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.090
You mean Ms Kitagawa?

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.050
I'm home.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.200
Sora?

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.330
Sora, l am home.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.410
If there's a possibility
that all of us will be suspected,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.330
we have to get
Mrs Kitagawa consent too.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.890
Let's make the decision later, then.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.490
We'll decide later.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.210
Are you not scared?

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.860
I carelessly wrote the name
of someone l know.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.940
Frankly, it's a long story
and l hate the person.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.660
But when l think that they might be
killed, I'm absolutely terrified.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.780
Oh, hello.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.480
Hello.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.540
It was horrible, wasn't it?

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.700
Oh, l watched that.
lt was interesting.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.580
What did you watch?

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.820
The musical movie you recommended.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.410
I recommended a few.
Which one was it?

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:16.370
If a film l watch is interesting,
l forget its title.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.770
The thought that the film
is interesting occupies my mind...

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:24.930
What the heck?

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.330
Well then, let's vote.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.370
Is that okay?

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.530
I think it's the only way.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.130
Okay.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.050
- Then...
- lt was just once.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.930
A murder just happened by chance.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.730
If you want to make all residents
here suspects, then raise your hand.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.530
- The way you say it...
- Raise your hand.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.140
We have decided
that we won't tell the police?

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.590
Sorry, l second that.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.110
Me too.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.110
You take her side
because you know the result.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.670
Tell me if you have
any other recommendations.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.110
- Sure.
- Thanks.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.590
Okay...

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.020
Have a good evening.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.220
- Nana.
- Yes?

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.340
I am sorry,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.140
l couldn't raise my hand right away.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.460
It's okay.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.260
I am sorry too.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.540
Don't worry about it.
Maybe l just worry too much.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.860
Who do you think you are?

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.420
What the heck is going on?

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.950
It's none of your business.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.950
How dare you!

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.870
Calm down.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.150
Sora, you'll go now?

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.470
Leave Sora alone!

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.750
Calm down and talk--

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.110
l am very calm!

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.630
Hands off him!

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.030
- Shut up!
- Hey...

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.790
And don't step on me!

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.270
Sorry about the fuss.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.510
It's okay, but...

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.190
Why do you act calm?

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.350
You are scaring Sora.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.590
Don't touch Sora!

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:46.750
Stop!

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:47.990
Don't touch him!

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.550
You...

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.060
This woman kidnapped Sora!

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.740
Sora and Mrs Kojima
often spend time together.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.380
I had played with him too.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.900
Sora told me that our neighbours
have been taking care of him,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.990
but something is wrong
with this woman!

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.950
A murder just happened, Yasu said
that he was scared, so l...

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.150
See?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.990
She called Sora "Yasu."

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.870
She gave him another name
and calls him that.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.230
This isn't right!

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.790
I just said the wrong name...

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.590
Who do you use Sora to replace?

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.750
Ms Kitagawa, l think it's enough...

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.910
Sora, take this off.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.070
What are you doing?

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.350
That woman made Sora wear this!

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.910
She forced Sora
to go to the barber with her

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.990
and changed Sora's hairstyle
the other day!

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.830
Darn!

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.430
Let's go home.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.510
Excuse me.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:44.230
Sora, let's go home.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.630
Your wife didn't tell you?</i>

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.990
It's the murder-swap game.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.970
Orangutan Time...

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.870
How was the residents' meeting?

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.990
Nothing special.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:17.270
It's Nana's habit
to cross her fingers when she lies.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.390
Why did they have
an urgent residents' meeting?

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.870
Well...

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.830
Not only did Nana not tell me
about the game,

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.200
but she even lied to me.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.160
If the property manager,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.740
the owner of the Bhutanese diner,

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.140
Mr and Mrs Akaike...

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.830
were murdered as part of the game...

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.580
Wait, she is worrying so much
on her own!

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.380
I feel so bad for Nana!

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.060
However...

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.820
lt's kind to let her worry.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.630
Very often, it's better to just let
the person solve the problem.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.870
What Big Bro said
was reasonable as well.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.910
But when will
the residents' meeting end?

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:27.790
Murderers' condo</i>

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:40.790
Excuse me.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:42.790
Yes?

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.030
Is the residents' meeting over?

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.630
I think it isn't held today.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.110
Manager's office</i>

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.420
She isn't here.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.340
Sorry for making you hide.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.500
It's okay.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.420
And...

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.900
l thought a bit
about telling everyone.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.900
I think l will tell you whose name
l wrote on my piece of paper.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.220
Yes?

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.140
Actually...

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.340
l wrote "Misato Akaike."

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.440
Misato Akaike</i>

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.600
The person
who drew my piece of paper

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.660
really carried out the murder.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.420
They even killed her husband.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.020
If you had said it
during the meeting,

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.880
maybe they would agree
to tell the police too.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.290
But if we talk to the police now,
l'll be the most likely the suspect.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.330
Moreover, if they ask
what l did that night,

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.570
l'd be in trouble.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.410
But you didn't kill them,
did you, Mr Ukita?

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.130
Of course l didn't kill them.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.330
But l'll be suspected
because of my current job too.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.770
Is that so...

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:48.170
Why did you want someone to kill
Mrs Akaike in the first place?

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.490
It didn't occur to me
that she would actually be killed.

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:55.570
You said the other day
that Mrs Akaike kept ignoring you.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.000
Well, the woman looks down on people
more stupid than her.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.040
She didn't seem as someone
who's like that to me.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.000
You know the young couple
who live at my place?

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.000
Airi told me...

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.130
You can't even send a postcard back?

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.170
I am sorry.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.530
I thought l had put a stamp on it.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.930
You didn't cross out the "to"
under the recipient.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.570
If the recipient had received this,
you would've embarrassed me.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:27.570
I am very sorry.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.270
The education you received

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.850
was different from mine and Goro's
and l know that,

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:39.010
but l thought you would catch up
if you had spent decades with us.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.170
Yes, l am sorry.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.610
I am glad that you have no children.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.530
The genes of idiots end here.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.970
That's what the old woman does
when she's alone with you?

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.130
If she does that again,
just punch her.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.290
Pardon?

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.610
Well, you shouldn't use violence...

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:09.760
Sorry.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.320
Could you be talking to me?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.680
Of course l am.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.360
I think you got the wrong idea.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.560
I don't worry about it so much
that l need a working girl's advice.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.480
What do you mean?

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.360
Look at your outfit,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.290
the words you say,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.250
isn't it obvious?

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.690
You jumbo woman!

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.970
She kept ignoring me during
residents' meetings after that.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:44.210
She didn't seem as someone
who's like that to me...

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.170
People often say, "Do unto others as
you would have them do unto you,"

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:51.690
but it's fancy talk.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.810
There are many people...

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.690
who do what other people did to them
to those weaker than they are.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.650
In the world, the weaker you are,
the more awful things happen to you.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.250
But even so, l didn't wish her dead.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.970
But the person who drew the ballot
paper that says "Misato Akaike"...

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.770
really killed Mrs Akaike.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.170
I want the murderer to be arrested,

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.050
but l don't want to be
dragged into trouble.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.080
Well...

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.520
We don't have to talk
about the game,

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.810
the police will naturally search
for the murderer.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.290
In addition...

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:44.610
We are going to do what we can
and search for the murderer.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.370
Please.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.930
Search for the murderer.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.530
Residents of the residential tower
who have no alibi

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.650
are these four people.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.770
The Bhutanese diner's waitress,

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.730
and he who has connections
with gangs.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.650
Keisuke Ukita</i>

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.330
Ukita has been arrested for fraud
many times.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.530
He's a smooth talker
and lies without batting an eye.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.960
What? Are you still worrying
about the cake?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.600
Yes.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.240
We verified that Misato Akaike
bought it herself, right?

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.400
But the cake's chocolate plaque
is the problem.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.840
There wasn't one.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.610
The shop clerk said
they didn't forget to put it there.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.850
Maybe it was eaten.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.370
Maybe if someone killed for you,</i>

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.570
it becomes your turn to kill.</i>

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.530
Did Xinyi kill Misato?</i>

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.080
Xinyi?

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.000
It's Tezuka.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.820
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.640
The stairway is right there.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.200
- Please wait a second.
- Okay.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.600
Is this okay?

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.720
- Yes, okay.
- Good.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.320
We'll go down the stairs.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.240
Slowly, please.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.840
- Be careful near the corners.
- Okay.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.240
Sanae.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.680
Someone is moving?

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.240
I think he is old Mrs Akaike's
relative.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.760
The old lady will enter
an elderly home with caring service.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.620
Well, l guess she wouldn't want
to return to the flat.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.040
- I'll put it here.
- Thank you...

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.560
lt's Mr Etou.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.720
I didn't know he was friends
with the Akaike family.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.000
Mrs Akaike, why don't you try it?

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.840
I'm sure that you'll look good!

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.520
- It is amazing!
- Really?

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.080
It really suits you!

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240
Nana.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.360
Will you be available
on the next holiday?

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.900
Let's have a break from this
and have lunch together.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.180
You can invite your husband.

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.800
English for Beginners
Recruiting theatre group members</i>

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.770
You're lying in bed again.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.170
I thought you had gotten
a bit better.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.320
I'm not lying here.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.440
I'm training my muscles.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.960
What is it this time?

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.480
I'll stop worrying about it.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.440
From now on, l'll do what l want.
You should do so too.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.360
What happened?

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.880
Don't think about what happened.
Think about what will happen.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:27.040
No. Think about what will happen
because of my own actions.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.800
That's the important thing, right?

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.680
Don't ask me to agree with you
so forcefully. l don't know.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.200
I will do it!

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.520

you won't even be suspected, right?</i>

Yes</i>

Murderer</i>

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.550
What the heck?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.680
Sorry, he suddenly said he wanted
to go somewhere first.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.570
Don't worry about it.

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.250
Welcome.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.650
Look, he's here.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.850
I... l'm meeting with someone.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:14.290
- Please come with me.
- Okay.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.330
Sorry, l am late.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:23.810
You...

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.970
Excuse me, this table isn't big
enough for all of you.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:28.730
We won't dine here.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.210
I see.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.390
Sorry.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.170
How can we help you?

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:39.050
I said l was going to meet you,
then they...

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:40.930
We want to ask why you deny us

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.970
from attending
the residents' meeting.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.930
It's our fault
that we didn't attend it,

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.330
but not attending and not allowed
to attend are different matters.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.570
Do we have to talk here?

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:55.250
I don't want someone to use violence
on me in a locked basement room.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.420
Violence?

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.940
Just say what you want and let's go.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.820
I heard that...

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.740
you played a dangerous game
at the residents' meeting.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.660
- What?
- Yes?

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.020
You promised not to say it!

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.660
Sorry, l break promises.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.940
You knew?

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.220
- Well...
- What is going on?

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.500
Will you explain to us?

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.930
In the end, they just hate us.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:35.850
Telling them that we know
about the game is enough for today.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:39.290
First of all,
nobody told us anything.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.130
- Right?
- Yes?

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:45.530
What is it?

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.930
Nothing.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:51.700
Hello.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.540
Hay fever?

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.220
This is really delicious, isn't it?

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.820
Yes, it is very delicious.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.340
How long are you going
to keep quiet?

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.710
I don't know what and how
l should tell you now.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.670
I see.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.270
That's true.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.590
It's okay. Tell me when you can.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.870
I'm sorry.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.690
Actually...

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.450
l have a present for you, Nana.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:44.490
Look!

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.260
Exchange diary.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:54.180
If there is something that you want
to tell me but don't know how,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.820
you can write on it from now on.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.060
Sorry, l made you worry.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.380
I hid it from you
and it was my fault.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.100
It's okay. lt's totally okay.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.580
And I'm sorry that...

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.620
Yes?

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.420
I am too old to exchange diary
with someone.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.690
I see...

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.770
l'll use it myself, then.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.830
Can l continue?

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.850
When did you find out?

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.000
Ono told me a while ago.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.510
Shota, are you okay?

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:38.030
I was wondering how much
the other people knew,

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.670
so l asked Miss Kinoshita.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.910
Then it became something serious.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.170
I didn't want to make you worry.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.620
If l had told you,

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.840
you'd do everything to deduce it
and probe into this.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.160
It had never occurred to me
that someone would actually die.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.960
Anyway, l thought l didn't have
to tell you at first,

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.680
but before l realised it,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.440
the matter became so serious
that l didn't know how to tell you.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.940
Don't talk so much.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.220
Yes?

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:11.420
You only have to tell me
to trust you and l will.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.960
I trusted you
even before you told me.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:21.650
I'm sorry.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.290
But in return,

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.810
l'll trust you
even if you lie to me.

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.050
I trust everything you say.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:35.270
Because to me,
everything you say is true.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.990
That's how much
I'm prepared to trust you.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.150
I'm not hiding anything.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.490
Trust me.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.510
Okay. l trust you.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.760
All right...

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.320
Then...

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.840
Let's do it!

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.480
Let's do what?

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.640
Well, we're married, but there was
a secret between us for a while,

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.470
so now, we should hide nothing
from each other

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.070
and reveal our bare selves
to each other.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.890
It's the shortcut to making up.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.920
Reveal our bare selves?

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.400
Let's make love
and make each other feel good.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.160
But Shota...

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.720
Missed call</i>

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:29.950
At such a late hour...

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:22.290
l'll go for a jog,
then go straight to work. Shota.</i>

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.370
Sorry about yesterday.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.450
Are you not worried about yourself?

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.610
Why do you ask out of the blue?

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.210
If l tell you this,

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.010
you'll probably accuse me
of opening people's bin bags.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.050
But l think this is too serious
to worry about that.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.730
Room 302's occupant</i>

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.450
l think you'll probably be killed.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:32.750
Hello?

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.390
Are you okay?

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:37.990
Yes, I'm fine.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:00.650
Sorry.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.570
I would like to ask you something.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.170
What is it?

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.290
Do you know the actor,
Yoshihiko Hakamada?

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.330
Yoshihiko Hakamada?

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.170
The Hakamada?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.880
Yes...

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.520
This Hakamada.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.880
Hakamada has a new girlfriend,
a dental hygienist</i>

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.480
Of course l know him.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.200
The one who sang the song.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.450
That song was 20 years ago.
How do you remember it?

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.210
I often sing it at karaoke.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.370
You are weird.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.170
What about him?

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:43.610
People say
that l look a lot like him.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.130
Indeed, Mr Kuzumi,
you do look like him.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.090
Because of that I wrote down that...

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.460
The person l want to kill
is Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.060
What...

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.580
Mr Hakamada, it's the extra script.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:00.620
Okay.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.820
It's embarrassing,</i>

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.200
but people often say l look like him
since a long time ago.</i>

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.920
As insults.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.080
Like "Yoshihiko in the morning
after he got drunk and had ramen."

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.860
Lately, they call me Reward Card.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.460
Also, if l say no to someone who
asks for an autograph in the street,

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.320
they tut at me.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.680
So when l go out,

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.610
l always wear these.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.810
Anyway, that's the only reason.</i>

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:41.930
I wished Hakamada would die,
so l wrote his name.</i>

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:44.170
Where is the toilet?

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:48.050
We are using one in someone's home
that's 10 minutes down the mountain.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.090
I'll drive you.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.610
It's fine. l'll find somewhere.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:51.890
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:54.650
- Don't make the hem dirty.
- All right.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.250
So you came to tell me?

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.690
I feel horrible that our neighbours
get suspicious about everything.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.090
So l frankly told you what l wrote,

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.530
and l want to retire from the game.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.270
None of our neighbours...

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.270
will go to kill Yoshihiko Hakamada,
right?

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.870
What?

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:34.510
Wait!

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.870
That was the name l wrote,

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:04.230
and this is the name l drew.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.310
But l don't know this man.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:13.990
Thank you.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.550
Asao Hosokawa</i>

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.310
You actually keep coming,

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.790
Mr Hosokawa.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:40.350
Yeah, l think l get along
with my gym trainer.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.190
Your Turn to Kill

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.710
A new threat!</i>
ls anyone threatening you?

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.070
You'd better not trust that person.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.710
"Their daily life is falling apart"
Why is my life a misery?

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:58.070
Punch me and get fired.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.980
This is nasty!

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.380
What is going on?

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.550
The whole thing
isn't a trap you set, or is it?
