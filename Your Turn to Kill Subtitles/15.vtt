00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.100
An murder-swap game that was played without me realising it

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.100
- My loved one was taken away...
- Nana-chan

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.080
Even after I decided to revenge...

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.590
My wife was killed.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.090
I want you to profile the criminal.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.620
All disturbing events happened...

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.180
A lot of people die in that apartment...

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090
Because of a murder-swap game.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.580
What do you mean?

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.600
I can't keep up with that!

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.080
- Did you see Soichi?
- No...

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.100
The child is missing.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.110
Soichi is not an ordinary child.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.400
I was worried that

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.900
Someone may be killed again.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.480
What? I was doing an experiment.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.920
What?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.420
What did you just say!?
Hey! Hey…!

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.990
Sora!

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870
Mom!

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.890
Good….

Here please.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
Thank you...

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.380
Detective, this boy.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.400
- Take him!
- Yes.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400
Well...

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.950
Excuse me.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.490
Is there anyone who was close to Sawa Kuroshima?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490
Eh... yes.
Yes...

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.880
By the way, the last time you met Ms. Kuroshima...

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880
What happened?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.400
That... yes, actually...

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.400
How is Ms. Kuroshima?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
Fortunately, she was able to avoid collision with the train.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.960
She was hit hard on the head by the impact of the fall.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.390
The situation is unpredictable.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.380
Huh...

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.400
Who is the culprit?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.880
Excuse me, but it's an ongoing investigation.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.880
- What?
- Oh no...

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.400
We checked the security camera,
but there are several people

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.420
We didn't know who pushed it.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.940
- That video...
- Can you show me that?

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.230
As is expected...

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.380
Are you a friend?
Do you have any idea?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.970
Hayakawa...

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.910
I was suddenly called by Professor Hayakawa.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.890
Professor Hayakawa...?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890
Ms. Kuroshima wrote Hayakawa name in the game.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.950
I see….

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.530
Excuse me, the Student Affairs Office of the University is here.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.900
Ah, We're going now.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.400
I have something to confirm.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.930
- This is bad timing.
- Timing?

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.930
There's a rumor that you might be in a disciplinary meeting.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.450
- Huh?
- Masashi Enomoto

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.910
started talking about your past bribery.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.910
In addition, incidents around the condo are continuing.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.400
It's because you didn't report about the game.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.390
Your conviction is terrible and you could be dismissed.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.990
Yes. Well, it might be better for you to deliver rignment letter

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.410
before your career is damaged.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.910
Think carefully.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.430
Well, you don't have time to think about it.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.440
Well, I make my decision quickly.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.440
What is it?

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.480
Oh...
The detectives were calling.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.920
Thank you.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.430
Would you like some coffee?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.440
Aren't you tired?

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.940
I'm here, so you'd better go home.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.420
Doyan, Are you okay?

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.340
I'm... totally...

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.900
But you already got me one?

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.920
Huh...?
You must be worried.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.920
I can only worry now.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.420
- I'm worried as much as I can.
- Yes.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.480
Sometimes I worry, sometimes people worry about me.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.920
It's possible because I'm alive.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.910
- So my wife...
- Yes.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.990
- She is out of danger.
- Ah... is that so...

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.910
And Soichi, was imprisoned in a juvenile classification home

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.910
The charge is as expected.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.910
Attempted murder.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.880
But he is still my beloved son.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.940
I have to tell you,
As for Soichi's interrogation...

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.490
Each animal

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.900
has a different way of opening its pupils when it dies.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.880
And what would that be like for a human?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.890
I want to see it

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.870
And when I heard that,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.930
How should I look?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.000
I don't blame myself for him turning out like this.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.880
You said he used to be handcuffed only when going to the bathroom.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.390
Yeah.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.370
According to Soichi's statement,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.390
he went out of the room

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.480
and broke into Fujii's room...

Yamagiwa was my classmate at university.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.480
I hated him since the old days

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.980
If you send them together,
It will be effective.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.030
Good! Let's do it.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.010
Takeshi Fujii.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.040
Are you familiar with this?

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.960
Wow...
Technology nowadays is great.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.900
Right?

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.890
I wanted to do eveything to help my mom.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.910
Are you sure?

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.430
Then...

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.480
There's nothing I can say now...

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.360
Don't you have anything else?

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.380

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.400

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.410
Doyan Doyan.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.970
Well...

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.000
- Let's go home.
- No, but...

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.500
Her parents are here, and we will bother them.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.900
- Huh?
- I'm pretty sure.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.570
The third person in the room that day...

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.470
I make decision quickly

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.930
I make decision quickly

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.500
- That detective.
- Wait a minute.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.420
In other words,
do you mean the partner of the Enomoto couple?

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.550
Yeah first
there were three people in that room...

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.890
- Nana-chan
- Shota...!

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.930
In the end, there was only that couple.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.050
When Kuroshima was discovered in room 303...

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.000
Are you okay?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.900
I heard that no one was around.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.420
Did he betray and run away?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.410
If Enomoto and his wife are not talking to the police.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.380
There is a possibility that they are still in cahoot.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.900
It's better not to rush and ask.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.900
Yes.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.400
I'll make sure he's cornered.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.390
So, as Masashi Enomoto stated

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.400
Did you leak the date of the illegal casino raid and receive money?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.900
Yes.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.380
As a condition of silence

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.420
You deliberately neglected to report
on the murder-swap game

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.420
to cause confusion about the investigation.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.470
If I get caught

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.890
I'll tell all about what you did two years ago.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.910
Therefore, I'll take responsibility

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.920
- Resignment...
- Don't jump to conclusions, Idiot!

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.420
However, as Mr. Enomoto says.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.420
I will admit an assault.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.910
Assault?

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.930
We only heard about the bribery from Enomoto.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.930
Huh?
Were you doing anything else?!

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.420
- Hey Kamiya!
- Ah….

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.910
Because of the bribery story

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.980
I had a fight with Enomoto in the park.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.910
Hey! What were you doing!

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.930
I was witnessed by the resident

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:13.020
That's true. You're idiot!

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.520
Huh...

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.930
What will happen?

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.430
Maybe disciplinary dismissal.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.430
- You asked for it.
- I know.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.480
Sorry for the inconvenience!

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.380
You might be contempt for me

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.380
But I donn't hate Mr. Mizuki.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.390
I don't hate?
It's subtlely rude!

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.390
Thank you very much for your help.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.970
OK! If you're sorry,
I'll do what I can.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.870
- Whatever you do now...
- No. No.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:08.910
This is the case where many people were killed.
If you can solve it.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.910
There is chance that you will be able to
receive only suspension as punishment.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.910
But from now, I'm under suspension.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.920
So! I solved it

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.920
I'll make it all your credit...

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.970
Expect it.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.920
So Sora was discharged
from the hospital.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.920
I'm not worried about his physical condition,
but I'm still worried about his mental state.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.430
- The analysis of Soichi was right.
- Yeah.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.970
However, what AI did during this period was

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.390
just looking for people who were
more likely to commit pleasure killings.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.930
Soichi had an alibi when Nana was killed...

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.910
Nothing has been solved.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.930
What to do next?

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.420
First, the database of past crimes has increased.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.960
Please look at the analysis result based on that.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.990
After all, the killings of Nana,
Akaike couple, and Mr. Ukita

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.910
The possibility of the same culprit is high.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.400
If you try to narrow down the criteria for each item.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.900
The reliability will decreased.
But in case of same culprit

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.400
Even if you add Kayo Kojima to the victim's data

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.410
The reliability does not change.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.940
- In other words...
- The culprit who killed Nana-san

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.440
is very likely to kill these five peaple.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.390
I don't know the purpose….

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.910
As a result, the culprit is...

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.320
Still uncertain.
Don't run out of control.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.380
- Mr. Nishimura, this.
- Yes, I will take it.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:11.400
1400 yen...

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.400
This is a private receipt, right?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.900
No, it's magic when I drew a poster.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.920
Then please bring that magic.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.480
What we bought with the budget of the residents' association
It belongs to the residents' association.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.400
Ah!

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.400
- Do you have receipt?
- Mr. Nishimura...

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.390
- Me?
- Me too

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:35.400
- I need to talk to Mr. Tezuka.
- Can I do it later?

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.910
- Not good.
- Hey! Are you going to run away?

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.430
- No, I'm going to get that magic...
- This person is really strange!

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.460
When the manager died

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.000
- Where were you?
- Do not ignore!

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.420
I was watching TV in the room.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.470
Just in front of the manager room...

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.410
I heard a small sound that the metal rubs.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:03.030
I had the opportunity to
hear the same sound later.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.400
What were
you doing in the manager room at that time?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.900
Oh... There was something I lent to the manager.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.380
I went to remind him but he was out.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.420
What did you lend?

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.470
A mahjong mat.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.480
After a while, it was returned as new.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.560
Is Nishimura here?

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.410
- Yes
- Please accept this as a token of apology.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.930
What did you mean by apology?

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.490
I heard that he made a hole
with a cigarette...

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.990
I think he bought a new one.
Wasn't it?

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.860
Oh, please get it.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.880
Oh, yes.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.390
Hey!

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.870
Well...

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.410
By the way, Mr. Nishimura

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.440
Since when did you know about
the murder-swap game?

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.940
- Are you still talking about this?
- This is the last question.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.470
Didn't we go to the restaurant together?

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.960
I heard you played a dangerous game
at the residents' meeting.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.960
Eh?

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.900
Isn't it a promise to not talk about that?

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.420
What were you doing there?

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.970
I was told by Ms. Kinoshita later,
so I asked at that time.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.470
I'm sure I explained... But...

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.560
First of all, we aren't told anything.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.060
- Hey?
- Huh? Yeah...

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.000
I will tell you if you
return my work materials.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.510
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.920
Oh, if you have a receipt,
you can brought it here.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.430
- Oh yes yes.
- Oh, I forgot.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.430
- I missed my budget...
- I'll get it.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.430
All right.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.410
Mr. Kamiya.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.910
- Can you take it off for a minute?
- Yes.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.950
What?

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.450
One thing I want you to answer honestly.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.900
You have heard about Soichi-kun?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.390
Until this time,
even Soichi is not doing anything

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.400
- There is a possibility of guilty...
- I will answer.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.940
What about the Akaike couple's incident?

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.070
There was no plate on the cake left on the spot.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.890
Didn't she eat it?

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.910
What are your thoughts?

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.390
I ate...

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.400
- Be honest.
- Really.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.390
At that time, Nana-san was watching the cake

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.440
I also noticed it right away.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.510
Culprit was trying to make the case

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.920
that's the game-related murder.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.920
While everyone was taking care of Grandma...

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.490
I contacted the police!

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.410
Why do you do that?

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.970
I mean, if the police noticed...

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.970
There was a possibility
that your sin would be found out.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.950
Thank you very much.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.450
Only one more.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.450
After all whose name did you write?

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.970
Is it Mr. Tokoshima...

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.980
the property manager?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.500
Yes….

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.900
Mr. Kamiya, This is bad!
I heard you're under suspension?

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.000
Mr. Mizuki, There is new
information from Sanae Enomoto.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.400
No... No...

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.410
I'm helping you because I'm counting on you.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.400
Let me summarize the numbers.
It is a little red.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.920
- I want to make up for it from the reserve.
- Yeah, more important than that.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.440
One of you did it again, didn't you?

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.490
On the railway!
What does this mean!? It's scary!

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.030
Let's talk about anything you know!

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.410
If so, please tell the police.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.410
- Don't distract me. Are you a killer?
- What?

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.420
Weren't we looking for Sora together?

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.900
- That's right.
- Then...

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.910
The culprit is...

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.420
Mr. Tezuka, right?

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.940
- Huh?
- Eh?

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.000
Because “I will kill all the residents of this condominium.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.930
- Haa!?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.420
Everyone.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.920
Is this a massacre?
Will you keep killing until the last one?

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.420
Did you really say that?

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.410
- I said that.
- Oh...

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.930
Why did you only said that to Ms. Ono?

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.990
Why are you so enthusiastic about the incident?

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.390
- That's right!
- Isn't too much...

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.910
- just for curiosity?
- That's all for the checkout...

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.410
- Well, sorry it's for the work.
- Eh?

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:36.910
- Ha?
- As I thought you're a reporter!

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.900
It's wrong.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.420
I mean, you guys didn't know me?

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.440
- I don't know.
- Do you know?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.010
- I don't know...
- I'm still not famous enough.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.410
What is it?

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.910
“Entertainer who tried to live in
a place that incident happened”

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.400
My name is The Southern Cross Minami!

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.900
Ha?

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.410
One week has passed since I lived
in a property a 15-minute walk from Sakai Station.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.940
From the first day, it gradually thickened.
Here is an example.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.490
Look at this!

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.410
It's the grudge of the person who died in this room.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.420
Wasn't it true?

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.420
Do you shoot this kind of video in this apartment?

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.910
Well I don't feel good.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:23.930
But it didn't sell until this year.
I'm not talented at the time.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.910
In this kind of niche
I have to do something extreme.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.460
What are you talking about?
You!

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.040
Ah! It hurts... Oh...!

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.900
No matter how much you keep going.
It can't be helped!

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.930
I'll make fun of it, so help me!

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.910
Try it!

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.910
- Hey...!
- Stop it!

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.420
- Calm down!
- Hey!

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.450
Let's calm down.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.350
Can you say the same thing if Kuroshima died!

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.440
If It can be solved by violent, I'll do…

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.960
Don't be meaningless.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.460
We can't solve this without the cooperation
of the residents.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.430
I'm sorry.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.970
There is something I want to show you.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.940
Okay.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.920
- It's finished.
- What did you do?

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.920
I installed the app I made.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:36.530
This is for Tezuka who
tends to take extreme actions

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.940
Think of it as an amulet.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.940
Amulet?

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.430
Originally developed for elderly people
who lost their spouse.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.950
- Eh... what?
- So

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.970
This app allows you to talk with Nana.

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:58.490
Well, For now,
It can speak only simple things.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.910
By talking back and forth,
It will become closer to the person.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.900
Doyan...

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.400
When anger cannot be suppressed

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.400
When you became hopelessly lonely.
Talk to it.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.940
I'm happy, but...

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.440
That makes me laugh

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.900
Well... If you feel like it.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.920
Nana-chan.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.440
What's wrong? Shota-kun.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.470
Nana-chan.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.470
What's wrong? Shota-kun.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.930
Where are you?

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.930
Come home early.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.960
Yup.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.460
What do you want to eat?

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.010
I want to meet...

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.010
Me too.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.420
Sorry.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.420
Nana-chan...

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.890
I said I'd protect you...

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:06.000
See to it that the culprit is lured and act on his own.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
I was stopped by Nana-chan...

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.890
That was exactly what Nana says.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.900
There's something I can't solve...

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.400
with just love.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.490
I want to meet you.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.400
Me too.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.910
I want to meet...

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.420
Me too.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.920
I want to meet...

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.910
Me too.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.400
Don't cry.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.940
These are the reasons for Kamiya's suspension.
He will probably be dismissed

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.430
You guys don't act like idiots.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.950
Yes.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.400
- Then Mizuki! Progress report.
- Yes.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.400
With the assumption that the game was played.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.920
I've confirmed the alibi of the residents.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.970
There was no change.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.910
Sawa Kuroshima, who is hospitalized,
has an alibi in every incident.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.400
Is it true that Sanae Enomoto wrote
the name of Hiroshi Tokoshima?

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.900
Yes, however at the estimated time of death of Tokoshima

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.420
The couple had an alibi.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.920
Is it possible that his son Soichi Enomoto killed Tokoshima?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.460
- I don't know
- But...

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.390
He is now proudly testifying about his crime.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.410
If he killed Tokoshima, I think he would confessed.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.910
If it was a game, the person who drew the paper might have killed him.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.440
I'm calling many times.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.960
Mr. Kamiya
Please call me back...

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.380
Yes

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.420
Oh, Mr. Nikaido,
I'm sorry you had to come every day.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.900
No.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.890
You're so kind coming every day.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.440
I'll take your kind offer.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.380
- Oh yes!
- I'll keep an eye on Sawacho properly.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.920
Honestly... I can't believe she have friends in Tokyo.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.400
I will contact you if something happens.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.910
Thank you.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.500
I'm here, so Ms. Ono...

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.890
I was able to be alone with Nikaido.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.890
Two people alone...

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.390
Oh yeah, Would you like to eat this?

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.950
I made these wafers myself.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.940
I'm sorry.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.440
I can't eat what people made.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.510
I'll eat it myself!

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.940
Do you often have such medical accidents?

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.490
Sometimes... but it is possible.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.950
Potassium chloride takes about 2 hours to drop the drip.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.920
If you do it for a short time, it will cause heart failure.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920
Hey...

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.960
Please ask me anything.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.460
I usually only talk to my coworkers or patients.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:32.450
It's fun to talk to a healthy amateur person.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.450
Yes.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.410
I don't know anyone, but please don't.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.430
I've lived 10 years in blood and sand.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.960
My face must have changed

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.000
- Yes, it's nice!
- No! Not at all!

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.440
- Huh?
- Is it okay? Your role is

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.440
A benefactor who helped this child 10 years ago.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.410
But you're ashamed of yourself with
the past that killed people.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.410
If she found out that a benefactor whom she has been searching for 10 years

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.430
Was a gangster,
she'll be shocked.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.950
I leave without revealing my circumstances.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.990
I'm leaving!
That's totally different!

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.420
Then if Mr. Tamiya does it...

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.430
I've lived 10 years in blood and sand.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:19.430
My face must have changed.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.900
You have clear eyes.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.420
Why do you kill people?

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:29.470
It's human slaughter! Drifter...

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:33.440
Are you saying my eyes are clear?

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.950
What a funny girl...

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.950
- Thanks for your work ~
- Thanks for your work

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.430
I'll bother you ~

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.440
Of course you already know,
Kono was my subordinate.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.420
You met him at the bank just before he died, didn't you?

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.460
Yes, I warned him about the game.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:12.020
Do you doubt me?
If I was going to do something.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.920
I wouldn't meet him at the old office.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:17.020
But there were troubles at the funeral.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.020
Ah… Wait!

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.430
Innocence!! I'm clear!!

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.990
It's like you

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.410
That's because there were many people who had the same shallow doubts as you

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.450
I have no doubt.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.170
Because you were the person who put the surveillance camera.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.050
To solve the incident.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.570
It didn't help though.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.580
By the way... Oh, excuse me.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.070
Yes, Mizuki.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.070
Yes….

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.660
- It's about Mr. Takafumi Kono...
- Yes.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.090
It took a long time to analyze
the video of the security camera.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.100
There were several people who are especially suspicious.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:05.070
They were all about 170 cm tall.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:09.090
It's 178.54.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.110
You're surprisingly tall.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:16.180
That's all.
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.100
Excuse me! Excuse me….

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:48.110
Yes, only the legs have been discovered.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.600
I'm sorry to ask you something strange.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.590
Some fingerprints of strangers were found in the room.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:00.620
The police found some of them.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.130
But at that time, there was a trouble at home.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.650
That….

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:13.190
You also lost your wife, right?

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.590
Yes.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.610
Did you love your wife?

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.610
Yes.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:25.110
Did you let your wife know how much you love her?

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.640
I'm...

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.690
confident.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.690
Huh... That's good.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.100
I couldn't tell at all.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:47.570
But we didn't look in different directions.

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.060
There is a little distance, but we went in the same direction.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.630
We were running side by side.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.130
There's always someone somewhere in sight.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:04.570
It's an excuse.
I was cheating on her.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.660
Yes, thank you.
“AI Nana-chan”.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.660
It was a machine, but it was not just a machine.

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.560
You should express your feelings properly.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.570
Yes?

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.580
Doyan may be not good at express your feelings.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.120
But it's still love that overflows.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.560
- Eh?
- Umm...

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.060
Doyan feel like your love is acting on your own.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:04.060
You can't stop yourself from trying to move.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.570
What are you talking about?

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.550
It's when

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.620
Kuroshima woke up.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:26.130
But... Who is this?

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:38.180
I'm sorry, you've called me many times.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.190
Yeah.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.700
Then tomorrow night.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.120
Excuse me!

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.600
Ah... Good morning.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.550
That's suddenly...

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.640
My husband didn't come back.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.140
Eh?

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.070
Ah, it's okay here.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.070
Don't forget to get in touch when you go out.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.560
Yes.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.070
Fu ~.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.600
Angelina ~!

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.640
Angelina!
Angelina...!

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.690
Angelina! I'm back…!

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:04.190
Ah... It's been a long time.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.590
Nice to meet you,
My name is Yoshihiko Hakamada.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.610
I've heard it helps to get back memory

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.600
If you live in the same environment as before,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.130
Are you familiar with that work?

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.150
I'm a doctor.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.650
And here is Kuzumi's room?

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:32.090
Ah...

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:36.590
Hey Hakamada!

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.100
Yes.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.100
Did you do it?

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.070
Huh?

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.080
Isn't it pretending to be memory loss?
Mr. Kuzumi.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:47.640
- Um... I'm Hakamada.
- No, no.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.590
You just said,
“I'm back” or “Long time no see”.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.580
I was listening.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.600
Aha I don't understand,
Could you go through the office?

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.600
Kuzumi is lying!
Kuzumi is a murderer!

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.600
Hey Fujii!

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.100
Ahh! Look.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.610
Give me a break...

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:12.580
Why do you notice it so soon?

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.600
Don't worry.
Actually, I did it too.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.600
- I guess so.
- Oh...

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.610
It's better to speak honestly and cooperate.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.580
I even beat the police.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.580
- Oh, how could you?
- It's that….

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:43.160
Doyan doesn't get irritated because you like Kuroshima-chan

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.600
It's great to meet such people

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.600
Nikaido...?

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.140
Grandma This is Chiunque Kuramae.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.610
The apartment where the grandma lived.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.610
Do you remember anything?

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.580
I'll introduce people who live here.

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.080
101 is Kuzumi.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.110
102 is Kayo Kojima.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.110
She had an English class in her room.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.060
- 103 is...
- As always, You're not good at talking.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.080
Misato.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.090
I'm sorry.
And I don't know what to do with it.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.570
I'm thirsty.

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.590
- Oh, would you like something to drink?
- I will drink.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.600
I'm saying I'm thirsty.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.130
Do you need to ask again?

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.690
If you ask, would you like something to drink?

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.070
You don't know how to use particles.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:37.090
Oh and then I want to have tea.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.590
Yes, I will buy it.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.090
Wait!

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.100
I will pay by myself.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.650
You asked me to borrow you.
You can't do that.

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.060
Yes. I'm going.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.580
Please rest for a while.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.100
Thank you very much.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.100
But it was really relieved!

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.590
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.120
Yeah, let's take a photo together.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.660
Before

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.610
Doyan feel like your love is acting on your own.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.080
See, Sawa, laugh, laugh.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.120
Eh now?

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:25.120
Mr. Nikaido, would you like to take a picture together?

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.120
I love you!

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:35.630
Even if you don't talk about anything, just being there is fun...

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.630
eh?

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.600
Ah….

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.100
What I wrote on paper was

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.090
Kayo Kojima

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.580
Good job.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.100
Ah ~!

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.120
Ahh! Ah ah ah...!

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.630
Orangutan time.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.630
Orangutan time!

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.090
Grandma was not participating in the game.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:26.640
There is a high possibility that
this paper was drawn by Misato.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.600
Mrs. Kojima was killed
after Misato died.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.600
In other words,
Misato did not kill Mrs. Kojima.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.120
Mr. Ukita.

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.110
Nana-chan.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.610
Akaike couple.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:48.130
There is a murderer who killed
these five people, including Mrs. Kojima.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.640
What do you think, Nana-chan?

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.640
I think it's bullseye.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:18.600
What is it?
Don't tell you're going to cancel.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.600
On the contrary, can we meet earlier than planned?

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.070
I think I know who killed your wife.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:27.550
I wanted to let you know as soon as possible.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.610
I will wait for you at planned location.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:40.570
Can I trust him?

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:44.050
Shota-kun, Believe in yourself.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.610
Mr. Kamiya

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.580
Ah ~~~‼
