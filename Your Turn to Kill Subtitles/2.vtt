00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.570
On the first day we moved
to our new flat,</i>

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.250
at the residents' association
meeting...</i>

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.760
- Do you want to kill me?
- Pardon?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.200
And our conversation started.</i>

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.600
Everyone has a moment

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.970
that they want to kill someone
or just want them dead, right?

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.050
I want to kill them
if I wouldn't be caught,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.210
but I will, right?

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.370
The police first checks
if there is someone

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.840
among the people the victim
knew had a motive to kill them.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.720
So if someone has no motive,
they won't be caught?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.040
I think it'd be difficult.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.440
Then no one will find out if we swap
the targets we want to kill.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.010
It's murder-swap, right?

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.010
Why don't we reveal it together?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.210
Before I realised,</i>

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.210
it turned into a game that we tell
each other who we want to kill.</i>

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.650
Do not show other people.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.730
Now, open it!

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.930

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.510

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.760
Yes. I had no idea
that it was a man at first,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.100
so I was shocked
when I went outside.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.550
Where was your husband at that time?

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.470
He is on a business trip.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.200
Good evening, Sir.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.520
Mr Mizuki.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.560
- Is he dead?
- Would you like to check?

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.320
Idiot! It's scary!
It's fine if you've checked.

- have you checked the roof?
- Yes, Sir.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.720
There was no trace of struggle,
so it could be suicide.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.920
If it's the case,
he could've fallen anywhere,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.280
but he fell in front of this flat.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.230
Does it mean anything?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.360
I see.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.120
- Sir, will you go to the roof--
- I said I'm scared!

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.210
- Mr Kamiya.
- Yes?

- Maybe I should take a day off?
- Why?

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.950
You must feel helpless on your own.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.390
I know I should mind
my own business,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.830
but this happened on
the first day you moved here,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.590
so I thought you must be worried.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.390
Yes, I am worried, but I'm okay.

Well, I'm the chairlady
of the residents' association,

so I guess you can't count on me.

Don't say that.
Thank you for coming.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.470
By the way, it was suicide, right?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.920
Why? Could he have been killed?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.230
No, it's just there are
so many police officers here.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.030
Indeed! If in the unlikely case
that it was murder, this--

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.950
It's shocking to know
that someone I know died.

And he killed himself.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960
Yes, he killed himself.

Why? Isn't it more inappropriate

to let the real culprit
go unpunished?

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.770
I think we should seek the truth.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.250
The police said it was suicide,
then it's the truth.

it's always the orangutan.

Only Room 301's Ono actually uses
the name plate made by the manager.

in a relationship?

No need to check and just send them.

now, then.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.690
Of course there'll be.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.170
"Room 101, Yuzuru Kuzumi"
But...

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.820
Even for someone who killed himself.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.210
Mr Fujii, what you said wasn't nice.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.370
Of course, I agree
that we should send flowers,

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.450
but how much gift money
should we send?

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.170
Let's discuss the amount.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.990
"Room 502, Misato Akaike"
Why don't we send a sum together?

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.430
But how much per person?
Let's agree on that.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.830
Mr Tamiya worked at a bank.
Let's ask him.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.750
My former job isn't related.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.510
But you must've been to many
funerals of small company owners

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.750
who killed themselves
because you didn't lend them money.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.910
You've been acting mean!

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.640
"Room 203, Xinyi"
Tamiya, you're always so unique.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.520
Xinyi, Mr Tamiya didn't say
anything funny.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.800
Gosh!

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200
I got it wrong!

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.040
How can you smile?

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.800
He could've been killed
because of you.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280
Because of me?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.880
If you hadn't said the police would
not find out about murder-swap,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.520
we wouldn't have told each other
who we wanted to kill.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.880
I didn't suggest the murder-swap.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.500
Wait. First of all, none of us wrote
the property manager, right?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.860
He was so close to us.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.060
What?

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.510
Actually...

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.350
This was pinned on the notice board.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.150
"Our property manager"

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.070
Whose handwriting is it?

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.630
Will you drop this?

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.790
But this...

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.350
Put yourselves in the shoes
of the person who wrote it.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.670
They wrote the manager's name
as a joke,

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.800
but he happened to kill himself.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.520
I'm sure that the person
can't describe how they feel now.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.600
You are right.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.360
That's why
they can't attend today...

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.920
That means it was Mrs Kitagawa?

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.880
"Room 304, Sumika Kitagawa"

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.920
We don't know who wrote it!

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640
I am sorry.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.880
In the end,
we all happily wrote a name.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.960
We're all accomplices.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.800
Don't say that! I am not involved!

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.400
- I am not either!
- Right?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.800
This is not right!

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.640
Let's throw it away. Give me this.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.200
What? Do you suspect me?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.230
Just so you know,
I wrote Yutaro Yamagiwa.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.370
Could you possibly mean
Doctor Yamagiwa?

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.770
"Dr Yamagiwa (Yutaro Yamagiwa)
Director of Yamagiwa Medical Clinic"

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.530
Who's that?

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.010
He appears on TV?

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.410
The doctor is a pundit
on talk shows.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.490
Yamagiwa was my classmate
in college.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.450
I've always hated him so much,

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.370
that I wanted to pull his head off
many times.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.950
Okay. I said it honestly.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.250
Whose name did you guys write?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.290
"Manager's office"

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.890
Why don't you say anything?

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.610
You guys are a lot more suspicious
than me.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.890
Stop it, Mr Fujii.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.650
So as I thought,
it wasn't a suicide.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.730
The man was murdered
by someone among you?

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.330
- I said...
- By the way,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.170
let's say that one of you
wrote "Our property manager" here.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.530
Someone killed the man
that you want dead,

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.700
so you have to kill the person
on the piece of paper you drew,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.780
or you'll violate the rule.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.640
Nobody mentioned this rule!

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.120
But you made someone
take the risk for you,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.880
how can you stay safe yourself?

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.440
Wait. We did write the name
of the person we want dead,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.560
we didn't tell anyone to kill them!

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.720
Well, that woman said you wouldn't
be caught if it was a murder-swap,

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.080
so someone took it seriously.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.400
I said, I didn't...

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.680
- What are you doing?
- Wait!

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.370
We all get suspicious
because of this.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.130
- It's evidence...
- I'll eat it.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.570
- Gosh!
- Mr Tamiya!

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.170
What are you doing? Spit it out!

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:10.970
He swallowed it.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.850
Nobody in this residential tower
is a murderer!

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.530
- You know...
- Yes?

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.810
I don't like to gossip,

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.170
but Mr Tamiya is too serious

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.730
and many things happened
to him at work.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.810
He was made to resign early
because of that.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.130
Even now, his serious power
has gotten too strong.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.450
Have a good evening...

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.250
Please move the tables to the edge.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.330
Okay.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.730
Please move this there.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.930
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:47.890
It's yours.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.050
I'll give you back the 1,000 yen.

Thanks for your help.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.290
- Well...
- Yes?

This is cute.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.570
Right?

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.290
It is cute, isn't it?

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:08.530
Excuse me.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.210
There you are!

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:12.850
He's my husband.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.810
Hello.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.130
What's the matter?

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.570
The window is broken.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.010
What?

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.490
What?

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.530
What happened?

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.210
The window!

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.730
Masashi?

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.730
Oops.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:06.060
So... I was passing by
when I saw the broken window.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:13.260
I think some of you don't know,
but I am a police officer.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.060
So I've been checking
the office again.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.380
Gosh, you startled me!

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.100
I thought it was
Mr Tokoshima's ghost.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.180
I did frighten you, didn't I?

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.420
Sorry for bringing you trouble.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.160
Oh, excuse me...

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.520
Yes?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.360
In the end, our property manager...

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.140
We inspected his home
and found that he had a disease.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.540
In other words?

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.540
He killed himself
after worrying for some time.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.940
At least, we think
that it wasn't a murder.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.020
I see.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.540
It was suicide.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.860
We had no idea
that he had a disease.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.340
I knew it!
I thought his face was pale.

a bit more helpful?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.540
I am sorry.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.300
Don't just say sorry.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.340

Receipt!

Okay.

we were having dinner outside.
It's the unmistakable truth.

Does the police suspect us?

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.370
No, nobody suspects us.

But! I'm saying, but...

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.030
I don't know who will try to frame
me at this period of time.

I'll cause everyone in

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.280
Yes.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.640
Sower with Setting Sun?
It's a nice painting.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.000
Misato could almost remember it.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.360
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.160
Speaking of setting sun,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.000
"The zinc roofing
eats a rice cracker..."

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.480
And then what?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.240
Yes?

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.380
Chuya.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.440
It's Chuya Nakahara's poem.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:27.200
"Ashes being thrown underhanded
go pale."

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.480
And?

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.920
Go pale...

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.040
"It is quiet
when the sun sets in spring."

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.440
I told you.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.960
Misato was just going to answer me.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:42.800
Yeah.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.080
The poem was written in
a middle school textbook.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.640
How can Misato not know it?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.200
I wasn't good at
Japanese literature.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.080
Oh, I am so sorry.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.920
Your Japanese is worse than
a middle school child.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.840
I had no idea. Will you forgive me?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.600
Of course.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.520
Glad to hear that!

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.160
I'm so happy!

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.760
It's nice that
you're always so happy.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.520
Thank you! I roll with laughter
every single day!

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.160
Let's go.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.040
Oh, hey?

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.080
Mr Tezuka?

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.800
- Oh! Hello.
- Hello.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.960
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, your hair accessory...

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.480
I mean...

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.720
Oh, this?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.700
It looks so good on me, right?

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.520
You praised me. I'm so happy.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.770
So maybe it isn't exactly
a thank you gift...

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.130
What is it?

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.720
Wafers.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.250
I made it.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:54.250
What?

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.850
I've never seen anyone
make wafers themselves.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.850
It isn't cut, so maybe
it's difficult to eat.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.290
- May I?
- Sure.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.250
Thank you.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.250
- It's good!
- It is, right?

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:09.850
I made it with organic rice flour.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.970
I haven't tried this before.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.570
Is there anything
that you have never tried before?

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.290
It can be anything,

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.850
I want to be your first, Mr Tezuka.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.290
What the heck? You're funny.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.970
But it's really good.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.330
Glad to hear that.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.860
Yes, there are three
of each color pattern,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.060
so there are 21 patterns in total.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.260
Yes. If you would check it.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.860
Okay, thank you.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.300
Sanae?

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.660
Sorry, I shouldn't cry.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.260
Reversing a car is difficult
until you get used to it.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.940
Okay, it's parked.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.020
Thank you so much!

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.500
I feel so ashamed of myself!

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.490
Mr Tezuka,
your new customer is here.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:41.890
Already?

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:46.410
Thanks.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.650
Mr Hosokawa,
who applied for our personal plan?

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.490
Yes, I'm Hosokawa.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.530
"Asao Hosokawa"

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.050
Your goal is to keep yourself fit,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.090
so we'll tighten your waistline
after you get used to it a bit.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.210
Sure. Thank you.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.650
You can count on me!

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.530
Okay, let's begin our first step.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.310
Please call me Sho
when we're doing the training.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.470
- Sho?
- Yes, Sho.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.460
But may I say no?

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.820
Does it make you shy?

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.670
Does anybody not feel shy?

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.670
But during training,
your body will be under stress,

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:33.430
it'll be difficult to call me
“trainer” or "Mr Tezuka".

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:35.510
So we'll keep our names short.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.030
My name is Shota,
so please call me Sho.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:39.710
Now, say "Sho"!

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.070
Sho.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.910
Once more.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:46.270
Sho.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.450
Say it louder.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:48.330
Sho!

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.450
Three times!

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.450
Sho! Sho! Sho!

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.090
Okay, let's do some stretching!

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.450
Then, the new customer said

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.330
that he loved detective stories,
so I was really happy too.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.780
What should I lend him?

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.370
Don't tell him how it ends.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.610
When you recommend someone
a detective story you like,

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.100
you say the ending first.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.420
I don't.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.860
"It's amazing!

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.940
The murderer was shot up to the sky
with the fireworks

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.380
and died in pieces mid-air!"

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.660
You said that.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.220
That was the best final scene.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.020
But I couldn't enjoy it
because I knew how it'd end.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.060
Okay.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.220
What?

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.580
What is that?

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.860
Oh, I bought it for a change.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.260
It's a coffee maker.
Its design is good, right?

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.100
Yeah. How much was it?

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.820
A bit over 30,000 yen?

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:38.180
It's expensive!

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.980
I stay at home all day,
it's capital investment.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.100
You did it again.
It's your bad habit.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.210
You use difficult words to try
to draw away my attention!

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:50.010
No, capital investment
aren't difficult words.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.810
Moreover, I paid it myself. Why not?

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:56.580
What? I didn't say it
because I have no money.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.890
Sorry. What is it, then?

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:00.090
Yes, indeed,

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.650
I can't pay half of the sum of that.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.490
I can't. But you've bought it.
So I'll pay.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.060
Because we own it together.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.050
I want everything in our flat
to be our common property.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.970
I'll buy things after asking you
next time.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.370
That's not what I mean.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.090
It is true that the amounts
of our income are different,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.570
but I don't want you to consider
my feelings and my income

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.970
and hold yourself back
from buying things you want.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.210
It makes me sad
if you're considerate in that way.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:33.860
But I don't want you to buy things
without considering me too.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:41.510
So just get something I can pay
half of from the start!

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:47.330
Say you want a coffee maker
that costs 5,800 yen!

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:49.690
My point is,

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.360
please be careful not to let me
find out how much it really is!

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.680
Oh, this is fine,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.080
but it is like I am lying to you,
and it makes me feel guilty.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.400
No. It's a lie if you consider
my feelings and I find out.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.640
But if I don't find out,
it's kindness.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.480
If you save up
to three kindnesses like that,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.160
it turns into love.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.680
On the contrary, if there is love,

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.230
you can show me such kindness
three times.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.280
Oh, I mean just in one day.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.640
Three times a day.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:27.480
That means, I can be kind to you
1,095 times in a year.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.280
It applies to the opposite case!
If you live up to 100 years old,

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.840
then you can show me
such kindness 54,750 more times!

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.380
You can do calculations so quickly!

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.660
I can do all addition, subtraction,
multiplication but not division.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.940
I'm glad that we're married.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.380
Why?

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.700
I don't know.

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.190
I just thought of that
when I looked at you just now.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.950
But your husband can't do division.
Everyone will laugh at you.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.510
Even if everyone laughs at me,
I fell in love with you.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.390
So I can't leave you anymore.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.530
Wait...

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.440
There were more varieties of things
at the supermarket we went to today.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.790
Yeah, let's find out more places.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.370
I found an interesting restaurant
right after we said that.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.770
What is Bhutan cuisine?

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.090
I'll look it up.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.050
Sir Tezuka!

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.890
- Take one.
- Thank you.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.850
- Take one.
- Thanks.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:49.910
Come with me.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.990
Welcome.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.990
- Oh, what.
- What?

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.270
In 2018...

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.790
You bump into your neighbours
quite often here.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.350
I came here to eat alone,
but there are four people now.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.430
Hey, beer!

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.230
Beer!

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.590
- Oh, beer?
- Yeah.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.810
Would you please wait?

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:14.890
What the heck?

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.250
This is very spicy.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.650
Bhutan cuisine seems to be
the world's most spicy.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.330
It's hot!

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.130
Tell me, where did you two meet?

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.270
Well, both of our jobs
are sports-related.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.630
All right, so you met at work?

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.770
No one I meet at work
falls in love with me,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.370
that's why it's tough for me!

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.530
Nobody knows what you're talking
about if you get angry suddenly.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:42.130
It's obvious!
I'm saying that I'm not popular.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:42.970
Right?

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.030
I'm impressed
that you got yourself a man.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.950
How did you get this young husband?

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.030
I...

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.880
Oh, I pursued her relentlessly.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.920
You pursued her?

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.830
I kept pursuing her,
but she kept rejecting me.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.830
About 30 times.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.350
Thirty times? Why?

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.030
Don't ask them every detail.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.760
It's fine! She wants to talk.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.000
Obviously, our age gap,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.350
and I had divorced once too.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:10.350
Correct!

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.520
Yours.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.920
Change the channel!

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.560
Would you please wait?

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.120
What the heck?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.200
It was found at another river...

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.640
It's the Doctor Yamagiwa you hate.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.520
That's why I want
to change the channel.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.920
You hate him? I quite like him.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.400
He doesn't just hate him. Right?

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.920
Speaking of which,
who drew my ballot paper?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.260
What paper?

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.100
Shota, try this.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:37.860
It's hot!

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.660
Fujii!

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.130
What? I have to change it myself?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:43.690
Let's start.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.470
Six buildings in Meguro were burned.

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.870
Anyway, many things happened
in the past.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.630
The doctor was his classmate
in college.

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:55.790
He is no big deal as a doctor,

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:59.110
but it annoys me that he earns
so much as a celebrity.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.790
This will never end
if you kill him just for that.

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:04.390
That's not all.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.670
What, for example?

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:08.870
What do you want to talk about?

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.030
Have you finally made up your mind
to marry Kaoru?

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.470
Well, almost like that.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.710
You've been dating
since you were students.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.710
I'm amazed
that she waited for so long.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.750
Kaoru?

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.430
Well, she's the girl you loved
originally, right?

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:32.870
What? She was just a cute junior
in the club I joined.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:34.790
But you confessed your love for her.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.770
It's been a long time,
so I'll tell you.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.450
At that time, Kaoru asked me

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.470
to pretend to be her boyfriend
because you were too persistent.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.710
It was boring just to pretend.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:48.910
So I slept with her.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:55.750
Well, whatever the reason was,

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:00.650
you dated for a long time
and you'll finally get married.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:01.690
I'm happy.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.730
No, I'm dating an actress.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.650
She's in the morning drama.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.850
What?

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.350
I'm thinking about marrying her.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:12.450
What about Kaoru?

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.690
That's why,

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.730
it's time to go for Kaoru.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.850
Maybe even you can do it too.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.210
Don't be afraid!

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:23.930
She won't cost you a lot,

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.130
even if you only have a modest
income as a hospital doctor,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:29.810
she isn't going to complain.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:31.650
I promise.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.300
Mr Fujii?

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:41.500
I can still stand it
if it was only about me,

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.700
but that's not all!

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.940
What?

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.140
It's not fun if I just kill him.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.020
I'll travel back in time

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.300
and kill Yamagiwa
when he was in college

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.180
and I'll start my life over again
in a world without him!

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.020
Mr Fujii!

00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.460
I want to kill him more and more!

00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.700
- Mr Fuji
- What?

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.580
Look!

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.860
What?

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.260
It was identified</i>

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.060
as the missing celebrity
and doctor,</i>

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.140
Yutaro Yamagiwa,
Doctor Yamagiwa.</i>

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.700
Our reporter, Sasaki,
is at the scene</i>

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.220
where the body was found.</i>

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.100
Dr Yutaro Yamagiwa's body
was found here</i>

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.940
in a forest in Isehara City,
Kanagawa Prefecture.</i>

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.900
In the forest 300 metres ahead,</i>

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.180
Dr Yamagiwa's body was found
buried underground.</i>

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.380
It wasn't me.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.860
Is it okay to leave Mr Fujii there?

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.980
Well, he wanted to be alone.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.100
Anyway, Yamagiwa--

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.900
Oh, hurry up! Run!

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.100
Hey, wait.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.780
Okay.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:55.740
What?

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.140
You two had better train
your quadriceps muscles again!

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:07.180
Could he be killed
by one of the residents as well?

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.060
"As well'? Please don't say that.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.460
Also...

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.580
Yes?

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.380
Did you tell your husband
about the game?

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:20.900
I didn't tell him.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.100
It's a long story.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.260
Xinyi.

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.020
We're closing.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.360
Fujii, what about the rule?

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.500
Rule? What are you talking about?

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.070
If someone killed your target,

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.010
you have to kill theirs.
You said this.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:54.490
I was joking. There is no such rule.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.490
You're saying
that you won't kill anyone?

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.650
Why do you only talk to me
so casually?

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.290
Fujii, just go home!

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.080
Someone killed the man
whom you want dead,

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:32.400
so you have to kill the person
on the piece of paper you drew too,

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.600
or you'll violate the rule.

Yeah, there's a follow-up story
about the murder.

In the news, it was only reported
that the body was dismembered,

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:29.160
but it seems that his head
hasn't been found, great detective.

I don't want to hear that
so early in the morning.
